# Corpus issues

1071 issues the taggers reported in the Sefaria text (October 2026), to work through by editing `corpus/siddur` (see `corpus/SCHEMA.md`). Each id is `<leaf path>:<ref>` (in a list of Hebrew or English segments). This list is no longer generated; delete entries as they're fixed.

### Missing text in the source (23)

- `Weekday/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Torah Study:3`: Segment :2 is absent from both Hebrew and English (ids run 1, 3). The text reads on continuously from Birkat Kohanim to "Eilu devarim", so probably nothing is lost, but the numbering gap is odd.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Reading from Sefer/Prayers for Welfare of the People`: This leaf (titled "Yehi Ratzon") is empty in both languages; the Yehi Ratzon prayers and Achenu are instead in the leaf "Raising the Torah" (segments 4-9), and no Mi Sheberach / prayers for the community, government or State appear in this chunk.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Service/Ten Commandments`: The Ten Commandments leaf is empty in both Hebrew and English (title only). The text of Aseret HaDibrot is missing.
- `Weekday/Minchah/Post Amidah/Vidui and 13 Middot`: Leaf is empty in Hebrew and English. Correct for Mincha (Vidui and the 13 Middot are not said at Mincha in Ashkenaz); the app should not show anything for this leaf.
- `Weekday/Minchah/Amida/Redemption:2`: The chazzan's separate Aneinu blessing (between Geulah and Refuah in the repetition on fast days) is only referenced by this rubric; its text is not in this chunk. The silent Aneinu is in the Response to Prayer leaf.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Additions for Motza'ei Shabbat/Veyiten Lekha`: The Veyiten Lecha leaf is empty in both Hebrew and English (title only). The text of Veyiten Lecha is missing.
- `Shabbat/Kabbalat Shabbat/Bameh Madlikin:9`: Bameh Madlikin (Hebrew, Shabbat ch. 2) is empty; only the English of the closing paragraph (Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Chanina...) is present, with no Hebrew. Bameh Madlikin is omitted when Yom Tov falls on Shabbat; the leaf has no Hebrew to attach that condition to.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Morning Blessings:19`: Birkot HaTorah (Asher bachar banu / La'asok / VeHa'arev na and Eilu devarim) is absent from this chunk; the id sequence of the Morning Blessings leaf jumps from 19 to 21.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Mizmor Letoda:1`: The Mizmor LeToda leaf has no text at all in this Shabbat file (it is not said on Shabbat); tagged weekday-only. The app should not expect segments here.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Holiness of God`: Leaf has no segments; its text (Atah Kadosh) was placed at the end of the Kedushah leaf.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Reading from Sefer/Mi Sheberach/Bat Mitzvah`: Bat Mitzvah Mi Sheberach leaf is empty.
- `Shabbat/Daytime Meal/Zemirot for Second Meal/Shimru Shabtotai:13`: Refrain abbreviated with ellipsis (שַׁבַּת הַיּוֹם לה', וּלְווּ עָלַי...); the same abbreviated refrain closes every stanza.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Amidah/Thanksgiving/Modim:5`: On ordinary days the Modim leaf stops at "מעולם קוינו לך" and omits "ועל כלם יתברך ... הטוב שמך ולך נאה להודות"; the text exists only in the Purim leaf (segments 4, 6, 7). The engine must splice them in on days without Al HaNissim.
- `Shabbat/Havdalah:17`: Havdalah leaf has no rubrics (wine cup first, then spices, then the flame, order and customs) and omits segments 10, 12, 14, 16; Veyiten Lecha/Vihi No'am belong to Motzaei Shabbat Maariv and are not here.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Amida for Maariv, Shacharit, Mincha/Kedusha:18`: Atta kadosh is tagged silent-Amidah only. The chazzan's repetition after this Kedushah (Le-dor va-dor nagid gadlecha ... ki El melech gadol vekadosh atta, for Shacharit) is not in the leaf.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Amida for Maariv, Shacharit, Mincha/Peace:1`: This leaf has only Sim Shalom (Shacharit). Mincha and Maariv of Yom Tov say Shalom Rav, which is not in this leaf, so Sim Shalom is tagged shacharit only.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Birkat Kohanim:2`: No version of the leaf for Mussaf without kohanim: the chazzan's "Elokeinu ve-Elokei avoteinu, barecheinu ba-bracha ha-meshuleshet" and the three verses are only in the Birkat Kohanim leaf of the Maariv/Shacharit/Mincha Amidah (when birkatKohanimChazzan).
- `Festivals/Prayer for Dew:12`: Stanza starts mid-sentence ("תהומות. הדום לרסיסו…"); the opening words of the Tal Gevurot piyyut appear to be missing.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/For Shabbat Chol Hamoed:32`: Only the label "קדיש שלם" is given; the Kaddish text is not in this leaf (same in the other Hoshanot leaves).
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:268`: The rubric block ends mid-word ("סליחה ב") and no selichah text follows it in the Fast of Gedalia leaf: the Polish-custom selichot (and the Vidui, Aneinu, Shema Koleinu, closing) are missing; the leaf stops after the Thirteen Attributes (seg 299). Text cut at source.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:299`: Leaf ends right after the second Thirteen Attributes; no Zechor, Shema Koleinu, Vidui, Aseh Lema'an, Aneinu or Rachamana, presumably composed by the app from shared Selichot text.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Ten of Tevet:40`: The last pizmon stanza (seg 40) is only the refrain "אבותי:" with no stanza text.
- `Festivals/Selichot/BaHaB:4`: The BaHaB leaf holds only the opening verses and the Thirteen Attributes (4 segments). No piyyut, Vidui, Aneinu or closing; presumably the app composes it from shared Selichot text.

### Misplaced text (16)

- `Weekday/Minchah/Amida/Concluding Passage:5`: Note about the chazzan saying Half Kaddish on days without Tachanun is copied from the Shacharit text. At Mincha the chazzan says Kaddish Shalem after the Amidah (and Tachanun, if said); the English adds that Tachanun is omitted at the preceding Mincha, which also belongs to the Shacharit context.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Birkat HaLevana:18`: The rubric says to say Aleinu and the Mourner's Kaddish after Kiddush Levana, but the Alenu and Mourner's Kaddish leaves come before the Levana leaf in this chunk. When Levana is said, Aleinu and Kaddish should follow it (and not be said twice).
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Ribon Kol HaOlamim:1`: Rubric says this is said after the Amidah at the end of Friday night davening, before leaving the synagogue, yet it is placed here after Kiddush/Eshet Chayil in the home sequence.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Korbanot/Order of the Temple Service:9`: Ribon HaOlamim (seg 9) is a general introduction to the day's sacrifices; given an x. node, x.korbanot.ribon_haolamim.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Mourner's Kaddish:1`: In the aseret yemei teshuva variant "לעלא לעלא מכל" belongs before "ברכתא" but the source puts it after it. Tagged in source order: on those days the words read "ברכתא לעלא לעלא מכל ושירתא". The app should fix this order or supply a replacement.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Kedushah:4`: Atah Kadosh (the silent Amidah's third blessing) sits in the Kedushah leaf, after the chazzan's Kedushah and 'Ledor Vador'; the 'Holiness of God' leaf is empty. Both belong to the third blessing: the chazzan says Kedushah + Ledor Vador in the repetition, individuals say Atah Kadosh silently.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Reading from Sefer/Half Kaddish:1`: Half Kaddish is printed before Hagbah ('Raising the Torah'); in Ashkenaz the Torah is raised and dressed first, then the chazzan says Half Kaddish, then the Haftarah. Also Mi Sheberachs and Birkat HaGomel come before it, which is right (after the reading).
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Pitum Haketoret:3`: The daily-psalm list (Hashir shehalviim) sits inside Pitum Haketoret; in Ashkenaz Shabbat Musaf it is not usually recited here. Tagged as part of Pitum Haketoret.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Amidah/Thanksgiving/Al Hanisim for Purim:4`: Segments 4, 6 and 7 of the Purim leaf ("ועל כלם יתברך", "וכל החיים יודוך", "ברוך אתה ה' הטוב שמך") are the closing of Modim common to every day, not only to Purim/Chanukah; only segments 1-3 are Purim-specific. They are tagged unconditional except segment 4 (tagged chanukah || purim as printed, though the plain Modim also needs it).
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Mourner's Kaddish:1`: Mourner's Kaddish: in the Ten Days of Repentance variant the italic alternative ("לעלא לעלא מכל") is printed after "מן כל ברכתא" instead of in place of "מן כל", so substituting alternatives gives "ברכתא לעלא לעלא מכל ושירתא". (In the Half Kaddish the italic is placed correctly.) Tagged with alt id leela.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Sanctity of the Day:38`: The Chol HaMoed Pesach / last days block (38-40) is printed after the shared "u-minchatam" paragraph (36) and the "Elokeinu" continuation note (37), though it is read before them. App should insert it before 36.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Avodah:2`: The text of Ve-sa'arev (printed in the Birkat Kohanim leaf, seg 4) belongs here; likewise the Avodah closing variants in segs 6 and 7 of that leaf.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Birkat Kohanim:4`: Ve-sa'arev (4) and the two closing variants (6, 7) belong to the Avodah blessing, not Birkat Kohanim.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Second Day of Sukkot:1`: Leaf names are misleading: "Second Day" holds the Hoshanot of Sunday and Tue/Wed/Fri, "Third Day" the Mon/Thu Hoshana (Eerokh Shu'i); "First Day" is day 1. Conditioned by hoshanaDay and dow instead. Hoshana Raba (day 7) is not in this chunk, so its leaf conditions use days 2-6.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Yom Kippur Katan:15`: Lamnatzeach (Ps. 20) comes before the rubric "begin here after the chazzan's repetition" (seg 16), so it is said before Mincha, not within the selichot proper. Leaf service is set to mincha but segments 1-15 precede the Amidah.
- `Kaddish/Kaddish achar HaKevura:8`: Ashkenaz siddur includes the Edot HaMizrach addition בְּרַחֲמָיו; tagged x_addBerachamav (off for Ashkenaz).

### Duplicated text (8)

- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Zemirot for Shabbat Evening/Yah Ribon:5`: Refrain printed in <small> after each stanza (he:5,10,15,20,25); intentional repetition of the chorus (he:1-2), tagged as prayer.
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Zemirot for Shabbat Evening/Tzur Mishelo:7`: Refrain printed in <small> after each stanza (he:7,12,17,22); intentional repeat of he:1-2, tagged as prayer.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/First Blessing before Shema:5`: The weekday-Yom-Tov instruction appears twice: as seg 1 (plain, alone) and again embedded at the start of seg 5. Both are tagged yomTov && !shabbat.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Half Kaddish:1`: This Half Kaddish is the same text as the Half Kaddish in "Reading from Sefer"; here it comes after the Torah is returned (before Musaf). The "Reading from Sefer" copy is misplaced (before Hagbah).
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Kaddish Shalem:1`: Second Kaddish Shalem leaf (outside the Amidah folder) repeats the Kaddish Shalem leaf inside the Amidah folder; the text is identical. Show only once after the Musaf Amidah.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Amidah/Holiness of God:2`: The closing "Baruch Atah ... HaEl HaKadosh" is printed both here (silent Amidah) and at the end of the Kedushah leaf (chazzan's repetition); intended, but the engine must show only one per mode.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Kedusha:10`: "Ani Hashem Elokeichem" is printed twice (9 with the Kahal-then-chazzan label, 10 unlabelled). Tagged 9 as congregation_then_chazzan and 10 as the chazzan's repeat; the app should say it once per role convention.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Birkat Kohanim:8`: Same Yehi Ratzon as segment 2 (with the alternative reading shetzivita in parentheses).

### Wrong vowels (20)

- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Vidui and 13 Middot:5`: "וַַיִּתְיַצֵּב" has a doubled patach on the vav.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Tachanun/For Monday and Thursday:8`: "וְאִם־לֺֹא" has two holams on the lamed.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Tachanun/For Monday and Thursday:4`: Missing holam in "אֱלהֵֽינוּ", "הושִׁיעֵֽנוּ" and "סְלִיחות/תְלוּיות"; the segment also contains invisible left-to-right marks (U+200E) inside words.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Additions for Motza'ei Shabbat/Viyehi Noam:2`: "ישֵׁב בְּסֵֽתֶר": the first yod has no holam; the word should read יֹשֵׁב. Same in Keri'at Shema al Hamita:11 (reported there too).
- `Weekday/Maariv/Keri'at Shema al Hamita:11`: "ישֵׁב": the yod has no holam (should be יֹשֵׁב).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Ma Tovu:5`: "תפילתי" has no niqqud (also in Tallit seg 4 "ותפילתי"); other words around it are vocalized.
- `Shabbat/Daytime Meal/Zemirot for Second Meal/Shimru Shabtotai:4`: וְלְּווּ has a stray dagesh/shva; should read וְלוּוּ.
- `Shabbat/Daytime Meal/Zemirot for Second Meal/Yom Zeh Mechubad:44`: וְשָּׂבָעְתָּ has an evident stray dagesh on the sin.
- `Shabbat/Daytime Meal/Zemirot for Second Meal/Yom Zeh Mechubad:13`: מְכֻבַּד in the refrain is vowelled differently from מְכֻבָּד in segment 1; inconsistent.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Kaddish Shalem:1`: Kaddish Shalem text has inconsistent spellings versus the other Kaddish leaves (e.g. "לְעֵילָא", "יְהֵא שְׁמֵהּ ... עָלְמַיָא" with one yod-qamatz) and the nested <small><em> tags are malformed; reported only, text unchanged.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Amida for Maariv, Shacharit, Mincha/Kedusha:8`: "לְדר וָדר" is missing its holam vav (should be לְדוֹר וָדוֹר); the same typo appears in Mussaf Kedusha:22. Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Kedusha:22`: "לְדר וָדר הַלְלוָּיהּ" is missing vowels/letters (should be לְדוֹר וָדוֹר הַלְלוּיָהּ); same in Kedusha:8 of the festival Amidah. Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/For Shabbat Chol Hamoed:28`: The Ani Vaho Shabbat paragraph is unvocalized, unlike the rest of the Hoshanot.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Sixth Day of Sukkot:22`: תּושִֽׁיעַ is missing the holam on the vav (compare תּוֹשִֽׁיעַ in the same piyyut). Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:56`: Stray dagesh in יְּרִיעוֹ (and similar). Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:62`: Stray dagesh in נָּף (and similar). Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:67`: Stray dagesh in מֻּשְׁלָכִֽים (and similar). Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:71`: Stray dagesh in יְּהוּדָֽ (and similar). Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:73`: Stray dagesh in לְּרֹֽאשׁ (and similar). Not fixed.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Esther:5`: וַיּשְׁמַע lacks the hiriq under the yod (should be וַיִּשְׁמַע).

### Risks for the engine (68)

- `Weekday/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Mizmor Letoda:2`: Mizmor LeToda is omitted on Shabbat, Yom Tov, Chol HaMoed Pesach, Erev Pesach (siddur note) and, by Rema, Erev Yom Kippur. Condition used: !pesach && !erevPesach && !erevYomKippur (Shabbat/Yom Tov are outside this weekday chunk).
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/Shema:12`: Shema :1-2 (El Melech Ne'eman) apply only without a minyan; :11-12 (chazzan repeats "Hashem Elokeichem emet") only with one. Conditioned on minyan / !minyan.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Amidah/Divine Might:3`: Outside Israel in summer neither alternative applies (no Morid HaTal in Ashkenaz diaspora), so nothing must be shown; the instruction "In summer" is tagged moridHatal so it also disappears.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Amidah/Temple Service:3`: Ya'aleh VeYavo is a single segment with inline per-occasion alternatives (Rosh Chodesh, Pesach, Sukkot); only the one matching the day should be shown, and the instruction labels hidden with them.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Avinu Malkenu:5`: On Tzom Gedaliah (a public fast inside the Ten Days of Repentance) the Aseret line "chadesh aleinu" and the "kotvenu" lines apply, not the fast-day lines; tagged publicFast && !aseretYemeiTeshuva for the fast-day alternatives.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Concluding Prayers/Kaddish Shalem:5`: Inline "(בעשי"ת ...)" alternatives in Kaddish (Leela/Oseh haShalom) are inside one segment with parentheses; a naive reader shows both forms. Split into alt parts here.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Concluding Prayers/Korbanot (Israel)/Ein Kelohenu`: The four "Korbanot (Israel)" leaves (Ein Kelokeinu, Pitum HaKetoret, Kaddish d'Rabbanan, Barchu) are tagged `il`; in the diaspora a naive reader would also show three Kaddish passages in a row. The first line of Ein Kelohenu (Kaveh el Hashem) repeats the last verse of LeDavid.
- `Weekday/Minchah/Post Amidah/Avinu Malkenu:5`: On Tzom Gedaliah (a public fast within the Ten Days) the "Kasveinu" lines and "Chadesh aleinu" apply, not the fast-day "Zachreinu" lines or "Barech aleinu". Tagged: Aseret lines when aseretYemeiTeshuva; fast-day lines when publicFast && !aseretYemeiTeshuva. Avinu Malkeinu on Mincha of Erev Shabbat (during the Ten Days) is not said; the avinuMalkeinu variable must handle that.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Vehu Rachum:2`: Vehu Rachum is omitted on Motzaei Shabbat and Motzaei Yom Tov; tagged !motzaeiShabbat && !motzaeiYomTov. The siddur gives no rubric for this.
- `Weekday/Minchah/Amida/Keduasha:14`: Kedushah is only in the chazzan's repetition (amidah: repetition) and only with a minyan; leaf title had a typo ("Keduasha"), fixed; the Kedushah now groups with the repetition.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Amidah/Holiness of God:1`: Shacharit boilerplate: "in the chazzan's repetition Kedushah is said here". Maariv has no chazzan's repetition or Kedushah, so the rubric is tagged when:"false" (amidah repetition, minyan) so it never shows. A naive reader would print it.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Kaddish Shalem:1`: On Motzaei Shabbat the order is: Half Kaddish (segments 2-6, up to "veimru amen"), then the Viyehi Noam leaf (Viyehi noam, Yosheiv beseter, Ve'atah kadosh), then the rest of Kaddish Shalem (segments 7-9, from "Titkabel"). The leaf is printed as one block before Viyehi Noam, so the reader must split the Kaddish leaf around that leaf on Motzaei Shabbat. Segments 2-6 are tagged kaddish.shalem for both cases.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Amidah/Patriarchs:5`: English placeholder cross-references ("see page 000") appear in the English for the forgotten Zochreinu note and in Birkat HaLevana:18 ("p. 000"); the app should not show page numbers.
- `Weekday/Maariv/LeDavid`: The leaf includes its own Mourner's Kaddish (segments 3-9) shown only when ledavid applies; the leaf must be hidden as a whole when LeDavid is not said (the earlier Mourner's Kaddish leaf still shows). Whether LeDavid is said at Maariv at all varies by community.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Amidah/Divine Might:2`: Summer "morid hatal" is printed here, but Ashkenaz outside Israel says nothing in summer. Tagged moridHatal (false for diaspora Ashkenaz) so it is hidden; the winter line is mashivHaruach. The English segment mixes the Musaf Shemini Atzeret/Pesach dates for both and is aligned whole.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Sefirat HaOmer:3`: Segment 3 is "Hayom [...]": the day count itself is a placeholder (no Hebrew day/week text, no English counterpart). The app must generate the count for omerDay and week/day split.
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Blessing the Children:1`: Blessing the children and Shalom Aleichem/Eshet Chayil/Kiddush are home rituals, not part of Maariv; a reader showing this chunk inside the synagogue service would be wrong.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/First Blessing before Shema:2`: Segs 2-4 are the Shabbat text and segs 5-6 the weekday-Yom-Tov text, with no per-day marker beyond the rubric. Tagged shabbat vs yomTov && !shabbat; Shabbat Yom Tov gets the Shabbat text.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Half Kaddish:1`: Aseret yemei teshuva variant: "לעלא [בעשי"ת לעלא לעלא מכל] מן כל ברכתא": the regular words "לעלא" and "מן כל" are dropped on those days (alt pieces tagged), but the source wording is ambiguous.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/Shema:6`: Seg 6 already ends with "אמת"; seg 7 (chazzan repeats "ה' אלהיכם אמת") then repeats it. Without a minyan only the "אמת" of seg 6 is said (together with "אל מלך נאמן", which is tagged !minyan).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Thanksgiving:3`: Al HaNissim is split across segments 3-5 with "לחנוכה:" and "לפורים:" printed as bare rubrics at the start of segments 4 and 5; show only the matching one. Segment 3 (opening line) is shared by both days.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Kaddish Shalem:1`: Kaddish Shalem is one segment with responses and 'ועונים:' rubrics inline, and a stray GRA variant (יתגדל/יתקדש with tzere) sits mid-text; a naive reader would print both spellings. Ten Days variants ('לעילא ולעילא מכל', 'השלום') are written as rubrics, not alternates.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Removing the Torah from the Ark/Vayehi Binsoa:3`: Segments 2-4 are festival-only (Thirteen Attributes on a weekday Yom Tov / Yom Kippur / Hoshana Raba; Ribono shel Olam on the three festivals and Shemini Atzeret) with the rubric as the first words of the segment; Vaani Tefilati (5) is always said. "פב"פ" is a name placeholder.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Reading from Sefer/Haftarah:8`: Segment 8 holds four holiday variants inline as <br> rubrics (Pesach / Shavuot / Sukkot / Shemini Atzeret) and 'לשבת' fragments; segments 7, 8 and 9 are alternatives for Shabbat / festivals / Rosh Hashana. Segment 6 ends with a fast-day rubric ('say up to here on public fasts').
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Communal Prayers/Prayer of the State of Israel:18`: The citation "(דברים ל,ד-ו)" is inline in the prayer line; the English puts the citation after the last quoted verse (en 25).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Communal Prayers/Birkat Hachodesh:4`: "ראש חדש פלוני יהיה ביום פלוני": the placeholders (month name, weekday) must be filled in by the app; announced on Shabbat Mevarchim only (not before Tishrei).
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Amidah/Kedushah:13`: The closing "Baruch ... HaEl HaKadosh" appears in both the Kedushah leaf (chazzan repetition) and the Holiness of God leaf ("Atah Kadosh", silent Amidah). The engine must show Kedushah + its closing only in the repetition and Atah Kadosh only in the silent Amidah, not both in one pass.
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Amidah/Divine Might:3`: Summer "Morid HaTal" line is printed; Ashkenaz outside Israel says it only by custom (tagged moridHatal, which should be false in diaspora Ashkenaz). Make sure neither line shows when neither variable is true.
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Amidah/Birkat Kohanim:6`: Birkat Kohanim leaf mixes the chazzan version (birkatKohanimChazzan) with the kohanim duchening version (kohanim); exactly one of the two should show.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Uva Letzion:1`: Uva LeTziyon leaf sits in Shabbat Mincha between Ashrei and Half Kaddish although the usual Ashkenaz custom omits it; a naive reader would always show it.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Kaddish Shalem:1`: Malformed nested HTML (<em><em>, unclosed <small>) around the "קהל: קבל ברחמים" lines; render from the tagged parts, not the raw HTML. In Ashkenaz usage the part "קבל ברחמים וברצון" is the chazzan's and the congregation's response; tagged as the siddur labels it (congregation).
- `Shabbat/Third Meal/Mizmor LeDavid:1`: Each verse starts with its Hebrew-letter number ("א ", "ב " ...) inside the text; the app should not read it as part of the prayer.
- `Shabbat/Havdalah:1`: Divine Name is printed as "יי" in the Havdalah leaf (elsewhere "ה'" or the Tetragrammaton); display rules must treat it as a Name.
- `Festivals/Rosh Chodesh/Hallel/Psalm 115:1`: On Rosh Chodesh (half Hallel) verses 1-11 (Lo lanu .. ezram umaginam hu) are skipped; split out with when=wholeHallel. A naive reader showing the whole psalm would say them.
- `Festivals/Rosh Chodesh/Hallel/Psalm 116:1`: On Rosh Chodesh half Hallel skips verses 1-11 (Ahavti .. kol haadam kozev) and resumes at Mah ashiv; split out with when=wholeHallel. Verse marker is glued to the word ("יבמָה"), no space.
- `Festivals/Rosh Chodesh/Hallel/Psalm 118:1`: Verse marker glued to the following word in verse 7 ("זיְהוָה"). Responsive tagging is for vv. 1-4 and 25-29 only.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Amida for Maariv, Shacharit, Mincha/Gevurot:3`: Morid HaTal is tagged moridHatal (Ashkenaz outside Israel says nothing in summer). "In summer" must not show a line for Ashkenaz diaspora by default.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Amida for Maariv, Shacharit, Mincha/Sanctity of the Day:3`: Vatodienu is said only at Maariv when Yom Tov follows Shabbat (and Yom Tov that follows Shabbat has a bearing on later days only for Havdalah, which is not in this leaf). Tagged maariv && motzaeiShabbat.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Kedusha:19`: Verses 20-22 (Adir adirenu ... Yimloch) are said only on weekday Chol HaMoed and skipped on Shabbat Chol HaMoed; also not part of the Yom Tov/Hoshana Raba version. Tagged CH && !shabbat. Section 23 (Le-dor va-dor) is said on all days.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Sanctity of the Day:36`: "ושעיר לכפר" is replaced by "ושני שעירים לכפר" on Shavuot (siddur prints the latter in brackets). Tagged as alt "seir": !shavuot / shavuot. The bracket label "בשבועות" split out as an instruction.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Sanctity of the Day:41`: Blocks 42-59 (Chol HaMoed Sukkot, one block per day of Sukkot) are labelled for Israel. Diaspora reads two blocks each day (safek d'yoma: day n and the day before). Tagged block n with: il && hMonth==7 && hDay==14+n, or diaspora && cholHamoedSukkot && hDay in [14+n, 15+n]. Verify with the engine; hDay-14 is the day of Sukkot.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Prayers in the Sukkah/Ushpizin:3`: Contains an inline placeholder (פב"פ אמתך, "name son of name, Your maidservant") that a person substitutes; not split because it sits inside the prayer.
- `Festivals/Prayer for Dew:1`: Dew is conditioned on pesach && yomTovDay == 1 (Musaf of the first day of Pesach); the engine must also treat Israel (one day) correctly.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:49`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:50`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:51`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.

- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:53`: Contains 2 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE FINAL MEM, WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:54`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE LAMED, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:55`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.

- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:57`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE RESH, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:58`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE TAV, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:60`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE ALEF, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:62`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE DALET, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:64`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE RESH, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:65`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:66`: Contains 3 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, WIDE RESH, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:67`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE FINAL MEM, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:69`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:71`: Contains 1 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE HE, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:73`: Contains 14 presentation-form wide letter(s) (WIDE ALEF, WIDE DALET, WIDE HE, WIDE LAMED, WIDE TAV, U+FB21-FB28) used for justification. A reader or search that matches the plain letters, or a font without these glyphs, will mis-handle them. Text left unchanged.
- `Festivals/Chanukah/Service for Lighting Chanukah Candles/Blessings on Chanukah Candles:7`: "First night" is tagged chanukahDay == 1. Night 1 is the evening of 24 Kislev, which is the start of Hebrew day 25 (chanukahDay 1) only if the engine rolls the day over at nightfall. Shehecheyanu is also said on a later night by someone lighting for the first time (not modelled).
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:42`: Ten Days variant is printed inline in an odd order: "לְעֵילָא <small>בעשרת ימי תשובה: וּלְעֵילָא מִכָּל</small> מִן כָּל". Ordinary days read לְעֵילָא + מִן כָּל; Ten Days read וּלְעֵילָא מִכָּל only. Split into when-guarded parts; a naive reader shows both.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:32`: Kaddish responses (ועונים: אמן / בריך הוא) are printed inline inside the chazzan's segments; segs 39-40 give the congregation's Yehei Shmei separately, so a naive reader shows the congregation's part as chazzan text.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Esther:33`: Refrain cues ("במתי:", "יום:") are printed as prefixes before each stanza and the last stands alone; a naive reader would show them as text. They are tagged as instructions (refrain cue), the refrain itself being the opening stanza.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Yom Kippur Katan:31`: Inline variant reading (נ"א זה כמה ימים) sits inside a prayer line; split out as a note, so a naive reader would say it as part of the text.
- `Kaddish/Kaddish Shalem:1`: Entire Kaddish Shalem is one segment with malformed nested <small>/<em> tags; parts keep the source HTML.

### Ambiguous tagging (61)

- `Weekday/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/First Blessing before Shema:5`: Kedushah of Yotzer: tagged role together / minyan (kahal says Kadosh and Baruch together). Someone praying alone omits it or reads it with trop, so the text is not conditioned on minyan.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Tefillin:11`: Saying Kadesh and VeHayah after the tefillin is a widespread custom, tagged unconditional.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Korbanot/Order of the Temple Service:2`: Ana BeKoach is a custom not universal in Ashkenaz; left unconditional since this siddur prints it.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Psalm 130:2`: Shir HaMaalot Mima'amakim is printed after Yishtabach and before Half Kaddish; some place it before Yishtabach. Followed the siddur.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Tachanun/God of Israel:1`: Not sure whether "Hashem Elokei Yisrael shuv..." (the Habet/Zarim series) is said every day Tachanun is said or only on Monday and Thursday; tagged tachanunShacharit && monThu following its placement among the Monday/Thursday additions.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Concluding Prayers/LeDavid:1`: LeDavid: the note says it is a good custom after every prayer, especially from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Hoshana Rabbah. Tagged with the existing seasonal variable `ledavid`; communities that say it all year (or never) are a minhag choice.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Concluding Prayers/Uva Letzion:3`: The bold verses of Uva Letzion (Kadosh, Baruch kevod, Hashem yimloch) are tagged role `together` (said aloud by the congregation); the siddur prints them in bold but gives no explicit role.
- `Weekday/Minchah/Amida/Peace:2`: "For a public fast day" Sim Shalom replaces Shalom Rav at Mincha. Tagged fastDay (includes Tisha B'Av); custom on Tisha B'Av Mincha for Sim Shalom/Aneinu is not stated by the siddur.
- `Weekday/Minchah/Amida/Birkat Kohanim:1`: Chazzan's Birkat Kohanim at Mincha tagged publicFast && birkatKohanimChazzan; whether it is said on Tisha B'Av Mincha is not stated (the variable excludes Tisha B'Av).
- `Weekday/Maariv/Blessings of the Shema/Third Blessing after Shema:2`: "Baruch Hashem le'olam" and Yiru Eineinu are omitted at Maariv in Israel in Ashkenaz custom; tagged diaspora. The siddur itself notes some authorities say it not at all.
- `Weekday/Minchah/Ashrei`: Raw leaf is named Ashrei but includes a Half Kaddish by the chazzan; split into mincha.ashrei and kaddish.half nodes. Minyan-only parts tagged minyan: true.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Amidah/Knowledge:2`: "Atah chonantanu" (the Havdalah addition) is printed in <small> with no rubric saying when. Tagged motzaeiShabbat || motzaeiYomTov (the English puts it in parentheses with no rubric either).
- `Weekday/Maariv/Birkat HaLevana`: Condition kiddushLevana is documented as "within the Kiddush Levana window (by day)", but Kiddush Levana is said at night; used as the closest existing variable.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Keri'at Shema al Hamita:20`: "Each verse three times": taken to cover Yevarechecha, Hinei lo yanum, Lishuatecha and Beshem Hashem (21-24); the second rubric (26) covers only Rigzu (27). Shir Hamaalot (25) is said once.
- `Shabbat/Kabbalat Shabbat/Lekha Dodi:18`: Lecha Dodi is tagged role responsive for every line (chazzan and congregation alternate verse and refrain); communities differ. turn_west and stand placed on the last verse (Bo'i VeShalom) and the refrain after it.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Veshamru:2`: "Lishalosh regalim" tagged pesach||shavuot||sukkot||shminiAtzeret||simchatTorah (Yom Tov that is also Shabbat, or Chol HaMoed Shabbat); Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur excluded. Whether Veshamru itself is said on Friday night Yom Tov varies by community.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Amidah/Temple Service:2`: Rubric says "Rosh Chodesh and Chol HaMoed". Tagged roshChodesh||cholHamoed. On Shabbat Chol HaMoed / Yom Tov Friday night a different Sanctity-of-the-Day text is normally used (Atah Vechartanu); this chunk is the plain-Shabbat flow.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Amidah/Peace:2`: In the Ten Days the siddur prints the chatima "Oseh HaShalom" in parentheses, and seg 3 gives the usual "HaMevarech et amo Yisrael baShalom". Tagged: Ten Days -> Oseh HaShalom (Ashkenaz custom), otherwise HaMevarech. Sefardi/other custom differs.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Me'ein Sheva:1`: Me'ein Sheva (Magen Avot) is said only with a minyan, and not on the first night of Pesach that falls on Friday night, nor in a house of mourning/bridegroom (per the English note). Tagged minyan:true only; no calendar condition. The Hebrew note on why it is repeated ("Yom Tov on Shabbat where Vayechulu cannot be said") is hard to reconcile with Vayechulu being printed just before it.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/LeDavid:3`: The Kaddish after LeDavid is gated with the leaf by ledavid (Elul to Hoshana Rabbah); the ordinary Mourner's Kaddish earlier in Maariv is ungated. Mourner's Kaddish segments have no mourner condition: the app should decide from the mourner variable.
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Zemirot for Shabbat Evening/Kol Mekadesh:30`: Hebrew lines 30-33 are an optional bracketed stanza ("Kadshem") printed in square brackets; no English. Tagged as ordinary prayer; whether it is sung varies by custom.
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Kiddush:7`: Parenthesized phrases "(כי הוא יום)" and "(כי בנו בחרת ... מכל העמים)" are variants/optional per community; left as one prayer part without condition.
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Kiddush:4`: Kiddush begins at he:2 "ויהי ערב ויהי בקר" (quietly) and continues in he:4 "יום הששי"; the two are one verse split across segments. Whole Kiddush is said by the head of household; Vayechulu customarily standing.
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Zemirot for Shabbat Evening/Ma Yedidut:9`: "<small>להתענג:</small>" is a cue to repeat the bold refrain (he:5 "להתענג בתענוגים..."); tagged as instruction, not prayer text.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/First Blessing before Shema:8`: Kedushah d'Yotzer verses (Kadosh, Baruch kevod) are tagged role together with minyan true; whether the chazzan repeats them aloud varies. No minyan: the verses are read with cantillation, not as Kedushah.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Mourner's Kaddish:1`: There is no `mourner` role. The mourner's lines are tagged chazzan, aloud, minyan; the leaf is not conditioned on `mourner` because everyone answers Amen.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Shochen Ad:1`: Ha'El BeTa'atzumot is tagged yomTov, Shochen Ad !yomTov (so Shabbat Yom Tov gets Ha'El and Shabbat Chol Hamoed gets Shochen Ad); custom on Yom Tov that falls on Shabbat varies. Chazzan role on Shochen Ad through Yishtabach: the siddur says only that the chazzan begins.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Korbanot/Ketoret:9`: Inline letter markers (<em><small>א</small></em> ...) number the spices; kept inside one prayer part rather than split.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Kaddish Shalem:1`: Kaddish Shalem is printed right after the Amidah, before the Torah service; no rubric says it is skipped without a minyan (tagged minyan: true).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Removing the Torah from the Ark/Vayehi Binsoa:2`: Rubric 'ביו"ט כשחל בחול, ויום כפור, ובהושענא רבה' tagged (yomTov && !shabbat) || yomKippur || hoshanaRaba; Ribono shel Olam tagged to the festivals incl. Chol HaMoed (rubric says 'שלוש רגלים' only).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Removing the Torah from the Ark/Shema Yisrael (Gadlu):1`: 'חו"ק' read as 'chazzan, then congregation' (chazzan leads, the congregation repeats).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Reading from Sefer/Haftarah:9`: Hebrew 7 tagged 'shabbat && !yomTov && !cholHamoedSukkot' (printed rubric 'בשבת ובשבת חול המועד פסח'); Yom Kippur is not provided for in this leaf.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Communal Prayers/Yekum Purkan:2`: Second Yekum Purkan (for the congregation) is tagged minyan: true on the strength of the note; it is customarily said after the first by the chazzan.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Communal Prayers/Birkat Hachodesh:5`: "בחורף - ולגשמים בעתם" tagged talUmatar (rain requested from 7 Cheshvan in Israel / Dec 4 outside).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Communal Prayers/Birkat Hachodesh:2`: Roles for Birkat HaChodesh: chazzan reads, the congregation repeats the announcement and "Chaverim kol Yisrael" (customary reading; no rubric).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Communal Prayers/Av HaRachamim:1`: Note says Av HaRachamim is not said on Shabbat Mevarchim, except when blessing Iyar, Sivan and Av (then it is said). The variable avHarachamim should encode this.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Returning Sefer to Aron:5`: Psalm 29 is tagged as said by the congregation together; some communities have the chazzan lead.
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Amidah/Kedushah:2`: Who says "Na'aritzcha" is unlabeled. Tagged "together" (the congregation says it with the chazzan); some say the chazzan alone.
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Amidah/Thanksgiving:7`: "בחנוכה ובפורים דמוקפין": Al HaNissim is said on Purim wherever it is observed (14 or 15 Adar); tagged chanukah || purim, ignoring the "walled cities" wording.
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Amidah/Sanctity of the Day/For Shabbat Rosh Chodesh:8`: "בשנת העיבור עד חודש ניסן" tagged as leapYear && hMonth >= 7 (Tishrei through Adar II, in a leap year), plus roshChodesh. Whether it applies before Rosh Chodesh Nisan itself or in other months is a matter of custom.
- `Shabbat/Musaf LeShabbat/Shir HaKavod:2`: Anim Zemirot lines are tagged by the chazzan/congregation labels, not the general "responsive" role; the last line is a chazzan line with no closing instruction (ark closing is not marked in the text).
- `Shabbat/Daytime Meal/Zemirot for Second Meal/Ki Eshmera:1`: Ki Eshmera is unvocalized and unpunctuated, unlike other zemirot here; a stray <em><small>בו</small></em> in seg 26 is left inside the prayer.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Torah Reading/Removing the Torah from Ark/Av Harachamim:1`: Av HaRachamim is normally said at Shabbat Shacharit; many Ashkenazim omit it at Mincha. Tagged with the avHarachamim variable as the siddur prints it; the engine should decide whether it applies at Mincha.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Torah Reading/Removing the Torah from Ark/Vetigaleh Veteraeh:1`: Contains the placeholder [פלוני בן פלוני] (name of the kohen) inside the chazzan's text; the app should substitute or show it as a blank.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Amidah/Temple Service:6`: Hebrew instructions use dash-separated labels ("בראש חדש - ..."); on Shabbat Chol HaMoed Pesach/Sukkot the matching variable is cholHamoedPesach/cholHamoedSukkot (Sukkot includes Hoshana Raba).
- `Festivals/Rosh Chodesh/Musaf Amidah for Rosh Chodesh/Sanctity of the Day:5`: Leap-year insertion "ulchaparat pasha": "until the month of Nisan" read as Rosh Chodesh Tishrei..Adar II (hMonth 7-13), excluding Rosh Chodesh Nisan.
- `Festivals/Rosh Chodesh/Musaf Amidah for Rosh Chodesh/Kedushah/Kedushat HaShem:10`: Kedushah is the chazzan's repetition only; the silent Kedushat HaShem (Atah kadosh) at 12-13 omits the Ten Days "HaMelech" variant. Ten Days cannot coincide with Rosh Chodesh Musaf in practice, but the rubric is tagged as printed.
- `Festivals/Rosh Chodesh/Musaf Amidah for Rosh Chodesh/Birkat Kohanim:2`: Whether the chazzan says Elokeinu veElokei avoteinu in Rosh Chodesh Musaf outside Israel varies; tagged birkatKohanimChazzan (no duchening) / kohanim as the siddur prints both.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Amida for Maariv, Shacharit, Mincha/Avot:1`: Siddur prints "Ki shem Hashem" only for Mincha here (and Adonai sefatai in every Amidah). Tagged Ki shem as mincha only and Adonai sefatai as !maariv; some customs say Ki shem Hashem before Shacharit too.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Birkat Kohanim:2`: The "kohanim: shetzivitanu / kahal: shetzivita" rubric: tagged both variants as said (kohanim say theirs, the congregation says its own) rather than as an either/or alt, since they are said by different people. Segment 8 prints the same Yehi Ratzon again (duplicate).
- `Festivals/Prayer for Dew:24`: The "בטל" refrains (Dew) and "בעבורו אל תמנע מים"/"בצדקו חון חשרת מים" refrains (Rain) are tagged congregation; some communities have the chazzan say them.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/For Shabbat Chol Hamoed:1`: Roles for Hoshanot are tagged congregation_then_chazzan (Hoshia et Amecha as chazzan_then_congregation); customs vary on who leads each refrain.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:73`: Segment 73 (Lecha Hashem hagedulah ... Shema Yisrael ... Baruch shem) is a closing prayer of the Hoshanot, not the Shema; tagged plain prayer with the Hoshanot role.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Fourth Day of Sukkot:1`: Hoshanot lines are tagged congregation_then_chazzan per the role table (kahal says each line, chazzan repeats); practice varies (chazzan leads, kahal repeats). Not tagged minyan:true because Hoshanot are said without a minyan too.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:256`: Seg 256 and 299 mix the end of the Thirteen Attributes (Vesalachta) with Selach lanu / Ki Atah. Tagged the first as 13 Middot (chazzan_then_congregation) and the rest as selichot.fast_day with no role; the siddur gives no speaker.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:46`: Opening verse blocks (Lecha Hashem Hatzedakah ... Hishtachavaya verses, segs 46-143) carry no speaker labels; left without a role though some communities have the chazzan lead each verse.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:41`: Kaddish Yehei Shmei (seg 40) is printed as the congregation joining the chazzan; tagged congregation per convention.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Ten of Tevet:15`: El Melech Yoshev and the Thirteen Attributes after each selichah (segs 15-17, 23-25, 41-43) tagged as tachanun.yud_gimmel_middot with chazzan_then_congregation, unlike sibling chunk 18 where the first two repetitions were tagged x.selichot.piyyut.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Yom Kippur Katan:112`: Psalm 8 (Lamnatzeach al HaGittit) follows the rubric "Full Kaddish, Aleinu and Mourner's Kaddish"; unclear whether it is said before or after them, or at all in the selichot service. Tagged as x.selichot.ykk_psalm8.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Yom Kippur Katan:16`: The rubric places the selichot after the Mincha Amidah repetition; no condition added beyond yomKippurKatan since the leaf is already scoped.
- `Berachot/Birkat Hanehenin/Eating/Brachot Achronot/Al Hamichyah:5`: Part 22: The text 'בְּיוֹם (טוֹב) מִקְרָא קֹדֶשׁ הַזֶּה' appears to be a generic closing for Yom Tov/Chol HaMoed, but the preceding parts are specific to Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, and Shmini Atzeret. The condition for this part should likely be 'yomTov || cholHamoed' to cover all cases, but the text itself might need clarification on whether it applies to all Yom Tov or just the ones listed.

### English alignment gaps (29)

- `Weekday/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Tefillin:1`: Leshem Yichud (Tefillin :1) has no English counterpart; English starts at :2 (aligned by id). Same for Tallit :2.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Tallit:2`: Leshem Yichud before the tallit blessing has no English segment.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Vidui and 13 Middot:1`: The English segment 1 is a note on the sitting posture for Tachanun (resting the brow on the arm); the Hebrew segment 1 is a different note (why the confession is in the plural). Neither has a counterpart.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Vidui and 13 Middot:1`: English-only note about the Tachanun posture; no Hebrew counterpart.
- `Weekday/Shacharit/Post Amidah/Tachanun/Half Kaddish:7`: Hebrew segment 7 is a note about announcements before Ashrei; English segment 7 says only "On days when the Torah is not read continue with Ashrei".
- `Weekday/Maariv/Sefirat HaOmer`: English is missing for the 49 daily counts (segments 6-54) and for segment 2 (Leshem yichud); only English segments 1, 3, 4, 5 and 55-65 exist.
- `Weekday/Maariv/Birkat HaLevana:3`: No English segment for the Hebrew "Hineni muchan umezuman" / Leshem yichud (segment 3); English ids go 2 then 4.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Sefirat HaOmer:5`: English Omer leaf has no segment for Hebrew seg 3 (Hayom [...]). Segments 4-14 align by number.
- `Shabbat/Shabbat Evening/Zemirot for Shabbat Evening/Tzamah Nafshi:13`: English covers only Hebrew lines 1-12 and 19-22; Hebrew lines 13-18 and 23-28 have no English. English lines are half-lines (two English segments per Hebrew line), and English ids skip numbers (5,10,15,20,25,30-47,52).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Psalm 34:1`: English (E1-E12) stops mid-verse 12 and covers only the first twelve verses; the Hebrew segment is the whole psalm. All English segments are aligned to he:1.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Pesukei Dezimra/Yishtabach:1`: English translation is a loose paraphrase ("god-emperor") and may be truncated.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/First Blessing before Shema:3`: English covers only El Adon (seg 3); the other segments have no English.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Blessings of the Shema/Second Blessing before Shema:1`: English is a single segment with an inline "(1)" marker for the whole Ahava Rabba.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Torah Reading/Reading from Sefer/Haftarah:8`: English segment 8 translates only the rubric of Hebrew 8; there is no English for the festival and Rosh Hashana versions (Hebrew 8 body and Hebrew 9 have no English).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Communal Prayers/Yekum Purkan:3`: English segment 3 is Hebrew text (only the closing lines of the Mi Sheberach for the congregation, from "וכל מי שעוסקים"); there is no English for Yekum Purkan or the rest of the Mi Sheberach.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Torah Reading/Reading from Sefer/Birkat HaTorah:8`: Segments 8 and 9 are one blessing split in two (the ending "נותן התורה" is its own segment); segment 10 is missing from the export.
- `Shabbat/Third Meal/Yedid Nefesh:1`: Yedid Nefesh verses are in segments 1,3,5,7 (2,4,6 absent from the export).
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:40`: English placeholder "......" with no Hebrew counterpart.
- `Festivals/Sukkot/Hosha'anot/Hosha'ana Rabba:42`: English placeholder "......" with no Hebrew counterpart.
- `Festivals/Chanukah/Service for Lighting Chanukah Candles/Maoz Tzur:1`: English is supplied only for the last stanza (Chasof zeroa, segments 26-29); stanzas 1-5 have no English.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Fast of Gedalia:3`: Segment ids skip numbers throughout the Gedalia leaf (2, 4, 6, 29-31, 33-37, 43-45, 47...), so the exporter may have dropped interleaved empty or English-only segments. Nothing is visibly missing from Ashrei.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Ten of Tevet:40`: English ends at seg 39 (the pizmon); the Hebrew Ten of Tevet leaf continues through seg 55 (Zechor, Shema Koleinu, Vidui, Aseh Lema'an, Aneinu, Rachamana) with no English counterpart.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Ten of Tevet:24`: English segs 24, 25, 34, 35, 36 have wrong or missing leading numbers ("16.", "17.", none) but align one-to-one by position with Hebrew segs 24-36.
- `Festivals/Selichot/Yom Kippur Katan:3`: Segment ids in the Yom Kippur Katan leaf skip numbers (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14), so some stanza lines may have been dropped by the exporter; the piyyut stanzas 3-11 are all printed without a refrain line.
- `Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:3`: Hebrew labels Psalm 126 for Shabbat; English explicitly includes Yom Tov and festive meals. The condition includes the English rubric; the concise Hebrew rendering retains its original wording.
- `Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:49`: English segment 49 (Hatov VeHameitiv) has no corresponding Hebrew segment in the selected input range (ends at 48). The Hebrew text for this blessing is missing from the selection.
- `Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:50`: English segment 50 (Harachman) has no corresponding Hebrew segment in the selected input range. The Hebrew text for this Harachman is missing from the selection.
- `Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:73`: English segment 73 is an instruction 'On Sukkos say:' but there is no corresponding Hebrew segment in the selected input (Hebrew 73 is missing from the selection, Hebrew 74 is the prayer). The Hebrew instruction for Sukkot is likely in a segment not included in the selection or missing.
- `Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:74`: English segment 74 is the prayer for Sukkot, but the corresponding Hebrew segment (he:Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:74) is not in the selected input list.

### Variables the taggers needed (15)

- `x_woman`: x_woman: the person davening is a woman. Women say "she'asani kirtzono" in place of "she'lo asani ishah"; whether women also say "she'lo asani goy/eved" varies, and only the "ishah" line is switched here.

- `Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:13`: x_zimunTen: at least ten qualifying diners participating in this Zimun; a meal-group count, not the prayer minyan flag.
- `Berachot/Birkat HaMazon:3`: x_festiveMeal: this is a festive meal such as a wedding, circumcision, or redemption of the firstborn, as specified by the English source rubric. This is a meal occasion, not a calendar flag.

### Customs the taggers needed (34)

- `x_noTefillinCholHamoed`: x_noTefillinCholHamoed: does not wear tefillin on Chol HaMoed (Israel and some Chassidic custom). Default (false) wears them, as in Ashkenaz outside Israel.

Practice varies; the siddur offers it only parenthetically. The usual ending (segment 4) is hidden only when aseretYemeiTeshuva && x_peaceEndsOsehHaShalom.
- `Shabbat/Kabbalat Shabbat/Yedid Nefesh:1`: x_saysYedidNefesh: Yedid Nefesh before Kabbalat Shabbat is a later custom, not said by every Ashkenazi community. True when the user wants it.
- `Shabbat/Kabbalat Shabbat/Ana Bekoach:1`: x_saysAnaBekoach: Ana BeKoach before Lecha Dodi is a custom that many Ashkenazi communities omit. True when the user wants it.
- `Shabbat/Maariv/Amidah/Thanksgiving:4`: x_saysNesVafele: the parenthesized "ve-asita imahem nes va-fele ve-node leshimcha hagadol selah" at the end of the Purim Al HaNissim is said only by some; its parentheses in the siddur mark it optional.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Preparatory Prayers/Korbanot/Order of the Temple Service:1`: x_anaBekoach: the community says Ana Bekoach (and the quiet Baruch Shem after it) after Abaye; not universal.
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Thanksgiving:5`: x_saysNesVafele: some customs add "ve'asita imahem nes vafele" at the end of Al HaNissim for Purim (printed here in italics as an optional addition).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Kaddish Shalem:1`: x_saysKabelBerachamim: 'Kabel berachamim uvratzon et tefilateinu' said by the congregation before Titkabal (not in every Ashkenazi minhag).
- `Shabbat/Shacharit/Amidah/Kaddish Shalem:1`: x_saysYehiShemEzri: the congregation's 'Yehi shem Hashem mevorach' and 'Ezri me'im Hashem' after Yehe Shelama (added in some customs only).

- `Shabbat/Minchah/Uva Letzion:1`: x_uvaLetzionShabbatMincha: the congregation says Uva LeTziyon (Kedushah deSidra) at Shabbat Mincha. Most Ashkenazim do not (it is said at Motzaei Shabbat Maariv); the siddur prints it here.
- `Shabbat/Minchah/Amidah/Divine Might:2`: Summer line "Morid HaTal" is tagged with moridHatal (Ashkenaz outside Israel says nothing in summer); the winter line uses mashivHaruach.
- `Festivals/Shalosh Regalim/Mussaf/Birkat Kohanim:6`: x_avodahUS: say the US-community ending of Avodah (ve-techezenah ... asher otcha levadcha beyirah na'avod) instead of the standard ending.

## chabad

### Misplaced text (2)

- `Shacharit/Ashrei Uva LeZion:10`: Yehalelu / 'Hodo' for returning the Torah is printed after Kaddish Shalem at the end of Ashrei Uva LeZion; on Monday/Thursday it belongs with returning the Torah scroll (before Ashrei), so a reader following the printed order would show it too late.
- `Blessings/Sheva Berakhot:7`: Borei Peri HaGafen is printed last in Sheva Berakhot, but it is said first, before the seven blessings.

### Risks for the engine (6)

- `Shacharit/Ashrei Uva LeZion:2`: The note lists the days without Tachanun in detail; Lamnatzeach is tagged tachanunShacharit, but the note also mentions a bris or chatan in the synagogue, which the engine only knows via the proposed bris / chatan variables.
- `Blessings/Birkat HaMazon:26`: Ya'aleh VeYavo rubric in this Birkat HaMazon says only Rosh Chodesh and Chol HaMoed and gives no wording for Yom Tov (Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret, Rosh Hashanah), so Yom Tov (and Shabbat Retzei) is not covered. Tagged as printed.
- `Blessings/Birkat HaMazon:3`: '<small>אברכה</small>' after Lamnatzeach points ahead to 'Avarcha' (seg 7), skipping Shir HaMaalot / Livnei Korach; tagged as an instruction when tachanunShacharit.
- `Blessings/Various Blessings:32`: Tevilat keilim: singular 'כלי' vs plural 'כלים' are alternatives selected by x_multipleVessels.
- `Blessings/Various Blessings:35`: Birkat HaIlanot tagged hMonth == 1 (Nissan); in practice it is said once the first blossoming is seen in Nissan, once a year.
- `Mishnayot for a Mourner:34`: El Malei contains a placeholder '(פלוני בן פלוני)' for the deceased's name; the app should substitute or prompt for the name.

### Ambiguous tagging (10)

- `Shacharit/The Amidah:6`: Part 2: Diaspora Ashkenaz does not say Morid HaTal in summer; the instruction 'In summer' implies it is said, but the custom is to say nothing. The condition !il is used to reflect that only Israel says it in summer.
- `Shacharit/Tachnun:10`: Instruction 'On Mondays and Thursdays' implies a condition, but the siddur does not explicitly state if this section is omitted on other days or if it is an addition. Assuming it is an addition for monThu.
- `Blessings/Birkat HaMazon:28`: '(בני ברית)' in 'כן יברך אותנו (בני ברית) כולנו' is printed in small type inside the blessing; unclear whether it is said (it is said only by a company of Jews / optional). Left untagged as part of the prayer.
- `Mincha/Tachanun:10`: The text mixes instructions for public fast days and the Ten Days of Repentance. The split separates the instruction from the prayer, but the prayer parts need distinct 'when' conditions to ensure correct display. The current split uses 'publicFast || aseretYemeiTeshuva' for the main block, but the specific lines for each condition are interleaved. This may require further splitting or a more complex condition logic.
- `Sefirat HaOmer:1`: The note mentions 'outside Israel' customs for counting after the Seder, but the condition for the leaf is 'omer' which applies to both. The note itself is a general instruction, but the specific timing 'after the Seder' is only relevant for the first night. The note also mentions a custom about eating before counting which is a halachic point.
- `Rosh Chodesh:6`: Part 2: Morid HaTal is said in summer outside Israel; condition !il && !mashivHaruach assumes standard Ashkenaz custom. Verify if this siddur follows that exactly or if there are local variations.
- `Mishnayot for a Mourner:33`: 'בעשי״ת השלום' replaces the preceding word 'שלום' in Oseh Shalom; tagged the replacement word as an alt on aseretYemeiTeshuva, but the plain 'שלום' stays in the text before it, so a naive reader shows both on the Ten Days.
- `Mishnayot for a Mourner:2`: Leaf 'when' set to mourner; the study (and El Malei) is also done on a yahrzeit, so the mourner variable should include yahrzeit observers.
- `Pidyon HaBen:3`: Roles for father (head_of_household) and kohen (kohanim) are the closest available values; no dedicated roles exist.
- `Mishnayot for a Mourner:34`: El Malei is not clearly part of the mishnayot study; tagged with an x. node x.mourner.el_malei.

### English alignment gaps (1)

- `Blessings/Birkat HaMazon:22`: Only 2 of the 33 Hebrew segments have an English counterpart (rubric 'On day when one does not read Tachanun' and Shir HaMaalot Beshuv); the English segments contain typos ('we we', 'and filled').

### Variables the taggers needed (8)

- `Blessings/Birkat HaMazon:13`: x_zimun: three or more adult men ate together, so Birkat HaMazon is said with a zimun.
- `Blessings/Various Blessings:32`: x_multipleVessels: immersing two or more vessels (plural wording of the blessing).
- `Blessings/Berakha Acharona:3`: x_ateGrain: ate a cooked/baked dish of the five grains (not bread) so Al HaMichya applies.
- `Blessings/Berakha Acharona:4`: x_drankWine: drank wine or grape juice, so Al HaGefen applies.
- `Blessings/Berakha Acharona:5`: x_ateSevenSpecies: ate fruit of the seven species (grape, fig, pomegranate, olive, date), so Al HaEtz applies.
- `Blessings/Berakha Acharona:15`: x_ateOtherFood: ate or drank something that requires Borei Nefashot.
- `Mishnayot for a Mourner:34`: x_deceasedMale: El Malei Rachamim for a male (שהלך לעולמו) is selected; user choice, not calendar.
- `Mishnayot for a Mourner:35`: x_deceasedFemale: El Malei Rachamim for a female (שהלכה לעולמה).

### Customs the taggers needed (4)

- `Shacharit/Rabbenu Tam:1`: x_wearsRabbenuTam: user/community puts on Rabbenu Tam tefillin after the service and reads the Shema in them (widespread Chabad custom).
- `Shacharit/Rabbenu Tam:7`: x_saysKadeshVehayaKiYeviacha: some also read Kadesh Li and VeHaya Ki Yeviacha (the other two passages of the tefillin) with Rabbenu Tam tefillin.
- `Shacharit/Six Remembrances`: x_saysSixRemembrances: says the Six Remembrances (Shesh Zechirot) after the service.
- `Mincha/Aleinu:1`: LeDavid before Aleinu in Mincha from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Hoshana Raba is a minhag that varies; some say it only on Mondays/Thursdays or not at all. Tagged with x_leDavidMinchaElul.

## edot_hamizrach

### Missing text in the source (16)

- `Weekday Shacharit/Amida:16`: The closing blessing 'Baruch atah Adonai, Ha'oneh b'et tzarah' is missing from the Hebrew text (h17 is unselected).
- `Weekday Shacharit/Kaveh:13`: English text 'Please [G·d] with the power...' has no Hebrew counterpart in the selected segments.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:49`: Text for Purim is present but not selected in the draft, though referenced in h46.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:51`: Text for Birkat Kohanim is missing from the source, only the heading is present.
- `Bedtime Shema:6`: English text for Hashkiveinu (h2) is missing in the Hebrew source; the Hebrew source only contains the instruction about timing and the citation.
- `Bedtime Shema:19`: English segment e17 contains only dots '......' and no actual text.
- `Post Meal Blessing:49`: Segment h49 (Rosh Hashanah Harachaman) is not selected but is part of the standard text flow.
- `Post Meal Blessing:50`: Segment h50 (Sukkot instruction) is not selected.
- `Post Meal Blessing:51`: Segment h51 (Sukkot Harachaman) is not selected.
- `Post Meal Blessing:52`: Segment h52 (Holidays instruction) is not selected.
- `Havdalah/Before Havdalah:17`: Segment h17 (list of 'Gates') is present in source but not selected for annotation. It appears to be part of the prayer in h16 or a separate piyyut. Needs review to determine if it should be included in the Havdalah sequence.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Amidah:17`: Segment h17 (Pesach) is not selected but is part of the conditional block for h16.3. It should be included in the split or selected.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:264`: Empty instruction segment, likely a formatting error or placeholder.
- `Purim/Shabbat Zachor:49`: Segments h49-h52 (continuation of the acrostic poem) are not selected but appear in the source; they should be included in the annotation if they are part of the standard text for this leaf.
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:52`: The heading for the 7th day is present, but the corresponding Torah portion (Numbers 7:30-38, Eliezer son of Deuel of Gad) and the specific prayer for the 7th day are missing from the provided segments.
- `Assorted Blessings and Prayers/Brit Mila:17`: Shema and subsequent verses (h17-h20) are not selected but appear in the source after h16; they are likely part of the ceremony but were excluded from the selection range.

### Misplaced text (2)

- `Weekday Arvit/Amidah:57`: English text describes Kabbalat Shabbat intentions, but Hebrew source is Weekday Arvit Amidah. Likely a copy-paste error in the source file.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:60`: Heading for Rosh Hashanah Kiddush (evening) appears in the Musaf leaf for Three Festivals.

### Wrong vowels (6)

- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:23`: Part 6: יוהוווהו should be יהוה
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:25`: יוהוווהו should be יהוה
- `Rosh Hodesh/Mussaf:13`: Part 14: יוהוווהו should be יהוה
- `Rosh Hodesh/Mussaf:35`: יוהוווהו should be יהוה
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:73`: Text reads 'עשתי עשר' (typo) instead of 'עשירי' or 'אחד עשר' for the eleventh day.
- `Fast Days and Mourning/Tenth of Tevet:5`: 'Coyote' is a mistranslation of 'Wolf' (Za'ev) in the Hebrew text.

### Ambiguous tagging (67)

- `The Midnight Rite/LeShem Yichud:2`: Part 1: The instruction lists many conditions for not saying Tikkun Chatzot or Tikkun Rachel/Leah. Some conditions (e.g., 'house of mourning', 'year of Shmitta') are not standard calendar variables and may require new minhag variables or complex logic.
- `The Midnight Rite/Tikkun Leah:4`: Condition for omitting Psalm 42 is 'days without Tachanun'. This includes Shabbat, Yom Tov, Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, Purim, etc. The siddur does not specify a single variable; the condition is effectively '!tachanun'.
- `Weekday Shacharit/The Shema:18`: The instruction to kiss tzitzit is embedded in the middle of the prayer text; the split point is unclear without visual context.
- `Weekday Shacharit/The Shema:19`: The instruction to stand is embedded in the middle of the prayer text; the split point is unclear without visual context.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amida:93`: Siddur prints Avinu Malkeinu lines with 'Avinu Malkeinu' repeated in the rubric. Custom varies on whether the congregation repeats the whole line or just the petition. Tagged as congregation_then_chazzan per Ashkenaz custom for these lines.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Vidui:11`: Instruction refers to 'Fasts and Mourning' section; condition for 'public fast days' is clear (publicFast), but the exact text to insert is not in this chunk.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amida:15`: Instruction says 'Chazzan says in the repetition' but the text is inside the silent Amidah leaf. Needs clarification if this is a note for the repetition or a misplaced segment.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amida:30`: The instruction mentions 'public fast' but the text is for 'three fasts' (Tammuz, Av, Tevet). The condition for the extended text (h31) is unclear without a specific variable for 'three fasts'.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amida:49`: Purim text is present but not selected; condition 'purim' should be applied to h49.1 if it is to be said.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amida:54`: Part 6: Instruction 'קהל עונים' is embedded in the blessing text; split may be needed to tag response separately.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Torah Reading:16`: Part 5: Instruction '[Amen]' is unclear if it is a rubric for the congregation to say or a note that the congregation says it.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:15`: Instruction says 'Chazzan says in repetition' but text is also in silent Amidah section. Needs clarification on when individual says it.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:32`: Instruction says 'individual says Aneinu' but text is in silent Amidah. Needs clarification on placement.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:52`: Instruction mentions 'Mincha Katanah' which is a specific custom; needs clarification on applicability.
- `Weekday Mincha/Vidui:16`: Instruction mentions 'Chol HaMoed Sukkot and Pesach' but does not specify which psalm is said; custom varies.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:97`: Avinu Malkeinu lines h97-h105 are shown in <small> but no explicit condition is given; they appear to be the standard Avinu Malkeinu text for Aseret Yemei Teshuva, but the siddur does not state the condition explicitly.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:49`: The text 'On Purim' is an instruction for a conditional insertion in Modim d'Rabbanan. The condition is 'purim'. The text itself is not said, only the following prayer.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:50`: The text 'During the Ten Days of Repentance' is an instruction for a conditional insertion in Modim d'Rabbanan. The condition is 'aseretYemeiTeshuva'. The text itself is not said, only the following prayer.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:52`: The instruction refers to 'Mincha K'tana' on a public fast. The condition should be 'publicFast && mincha'. The text is an instruction, not a prayer.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:53`: The text is a Kabbalistic formula said by the kohen before raising hands. It is not part of the standard Amidah text but a custom. The condition is 'birkatKohaminChazzan' or 'kohanim'.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:54`: The text is a Kabbalistic formula said by the kohen before raising hands. It is not part of the standard Amidah text but a custom. The condition is 'birkatKohaminChazzan' or 'kohanim'.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:55`: The text is an instruction for the chazzan and kohanim. It is not a prayer itself.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:56`: The text is an instruction for the chazzan and kohanim. It is not a prayer itself.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:57`: The text is the Priestly Blessing. The role is 'kohanim' and the voice is 'aloud'. The congregation answers 'Amen'.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:58`: The text is an instruction for the kohanim to turn their faces toward the Ark. It is not a prayer itself.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:59`: The text is an instruction for the chazzan to say the Priestly Blessing if there are no kohanim. It is not a prayer itself.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:60`: The text is the chazzan's introduction to the Priestly Blessing when there are no kohanim. The role is 'chazzan' and the voice is 'aloud'.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:61`: The text is the first line of the Priestly Blessing said by the chazzan. The role is 'chazzan' and the voice is 'aloud'. The congregation answers 'K'n Yehi Ratzon'.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:62`: The text is the second line of the Priestly Blessing said by the chazzan. The role is 'chazzan' and the voice is 'aloud'. The congregation answers 'K'n Yehi Ratzon'.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:63`: The text is the third line of the Priestly Blessing said by the chazzan. The role is 'chazzan' and the voice is 'aloud'. The congregation answers 'K'n Yehi Ratzon'.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:64`: The text is the Sim Shalom blessing. The role is 'chazzan' and the voice is 'aloud'. The congregation answers 'Amen'.
- `Weekday Arvit/Amidah:49`: The instruction mentions 'Rav from Berakhot 16b' but the text is a long supplication. The Chida's siddur may have a specific version; the text provided seems to be a composite or a different prayer entirely. The condition for saying this is unclear (Motzaei Shabbat only? Daily?).
- `Weekday Arvit/Amidah:50`: The instruction 'During the Ten Days of Repentance' applies to the word 'HaShalom' (השלום) inserted in the blessing. The draft splits the text but the condition should be on the specific part containing 'השלום' or the whole blessing if the custom is to say the whole blessing differently. The current split puts the condition on the instruction and the subsequent parts, which is correct for the text flow, but the 'en' translation needs to reflect the insertion clearly.
- `Weekday Arvit/Amidah:20`: Blessing 'Mekabets Nidchei Yisrael' (Gathering exiles) is typically said only during Aseret Yemei Teshuva in the silent Amidah, but the siddur text here lacks an explicit instruction limiting it to that period.
- `Weekday Arvit/Amidah:18`: Instruction 'In winter' implies mashivHaruach, but in Israel the text is not said in winter (they say Morid HaTal in summer and Mashiv HaRuach in winter). The condition mashivHaruach is used for the prayer text, but the instruction text might be misleading for Israel users.
- `Counting of the Omer:2`: Instruction to skip verses on 49th day is embedded in prayer text; needs split.
- `Counting of the Omer:146`: Instruction '4 Sivan' appears to be a date marker for the following line, but the condition logic for Omer days vs calendar dates needs verification. Tagged as instruction with gloss.
- `Bedtime Shema:2`: The Hebrew instruction mentions reciting the order after midnight, but the actual text of Hashkiveinu (the blessing) is not present in the Hebrew segments provided in this chunk, only the instruction.
- `Shabbat Candle Lighting:2`: Kabbalistic text with specific customs (3 coins, specific unifications) not standard in all nusachim; marked as optional via x_sevenCandles for the 7-candle variant.
- `Shabbat Evening/Atkenu Seudata:18`: Parenthetical text in Azmar Bishvachin (h18) is printed in small font; unclear if it is a standard part of the poem or a conditional addition.
- `Shabbat Evening/Songs for Shabbat:145`: Acrostic 'Edes' (עדס) is unclear; may be a specific custom or typo for a different word.
- `Al Hamihya:10`: Part 5: The text 'טוב' appears in the prayer part for Yom Tov, but the instruction 'ביום טוב:' precedes it. The split logic needs to ensure the word 'טוב' is correctly associated with the Yom Tov condition, not the general Pesach condition.
- `Shabbat Shacharit/Pesukei D'Zimra:15`: Part 2: The instruction 'Until here, standing' implies the rest is said sitting, but the siddur does not explicitly state to sit afterwards. Standard custom is to sit after the standing portion.
- `Shabbat Shacharit/Amidah:51`: Instruction 'On Shabbat Shuva' appears as a nested small tag inside the Avinu Malkeinu heading; unclear if it applies to the whole section or just the first line.
- `Shabbat Shacharit/Amidah:16`: Instruction says 'add' but the text of Ya'aleh VeYavo (h17-h20) is not selected in the current context. The app needs to know that h17-h20 are the text to be added when the condition is met.
- `Shabbat Mincha/Uva LeSion:20`: Text contains [ונשובה] in brackets; unclear if this is a variant or a correction for a typo in the source.
- `Shabbat Mussaf/Amida:17`: Unselected conditional block for Shabbat Rosh Chodesh (h17-h20) replaces h14-h16. Condition should be 'shabbat && roshChodesh'.
- `Rosh Hodesh/Song of the Day:14`: Instruction 'On Chanukah we say' implies a conditional text, but the text is a full Psalm (30). In some nusachim this is said only on Chanukah, in others it is the standard Rosh Chodesh shir shel yom. The condition 'chanukah' is applied, but the custom varies.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:162`: English text appears to be Kabbalistic commentary on Sukkah, not a direct translation of the Hebrew Musaf text provided. No Hebrew counterpart found in the selected segments.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:145`: Karti (carrot) instruction and prayer not selected; unclear if part of this sequence or separate.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:146`: Salka (spinach) instruction and prayer not selected; unclear if part of this sequence or separate.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:147`: Kara (leek) instruction and prayer not selected; unclear if part of this sequence or separate.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:148`: Rimon (pomegranate) instruction and prayer not selected; unclear if part of this sequence or separate.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:161`: Long kavanah text for Ushpizin; unclear if this is a standard prayer or a custom-specific insertion. The text is not selected for annotation but appears in the leaf.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:177`: Verse for the second letter of Ehyeh? Not selected, but likely part of the sequence.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:177`: Rosh Hashanah verses (h177-h184) appear in a leaf tagged for Pesach/Shavuot/Sukkot. These verses are specific to Rosh Hashanah (Malchuyot/Zichronot/Shofarot context) and do not fit the 'Three Festivals' (Pesach/Shavuot/Sukkot) Musaf context unless the leaf is mislabeled or the text is a general collection.
- `Purim/Shabbat Zachor:49`: The selection ends at h48, but the poem continues in h49-h52. It is unclear if the siddur intends to truncate the poem or if the selection is incomplete.
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:2`: The instruction mentions reading Ezekiel 37 and a Zohar section, but the text for Ezekiel 37 appears later (h11) and the Zohar (h14-h23) is also later. The instruction implies they are read 'as arranged here', but the arrangement in the file separates them. It is unclear if the instruction in h2 applies to the whole chunk or just the first day's reading.
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:29`: The instruction says 'Some add to say every day: ... as shown above in the reading for the 1st of Nissan.' This implies that the Ezekiel and Zohar sections (h11, h14-h23) are repeated daily, but the text for the 2nd day (h28) is followed by a specific prayer for the 2nd day (h31-h32). It is unclear if the Ezekiel/Zohar are read before or after the daily specific prayer, or if they are omitted on days 2-7 in favor of the specific prayer.
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:85`: Text contains '[ואמר]' indicating a textual variant or correction in the source; unclear which reading is intended for the final text.
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:85`: Text contains '[וצניף]' indicating a textual variant or correction in the source; unclear which reading is intended for the final text.
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:88`: Text contains '[תרום]' indicating a textual variant or correction in the source; unclear which reading is intended for the final text.
- `Nissan/Learning of the Day:76`: Text contains '[ינון]' indicating a textual variant or correction in the source; unclear which reading is intended for the final text.
- `Assorted Blessings and Prayers/Building a Fence:3`: The text mixes Kabbalistic intent (Yichud) with the standard blessing. The first part (h3.0-h3.5) is a declaration of intent, not the blessing itself. The blessing starts at 'Baruch atah'. The current split treats the whole block as one segment with parts, but the first parts are clearly instructions/declarations, not prayer text to be recited as part of the blessing formula. The 'prayer' kind on h3.0-h3.5 is questionable; they are more like 'instruction' or 'commentary' on the intent.
- `Assorted Blessings and Prayers/Brit Mila:30`: Role of mohel's blessing: draft says 'mouner' but context implies mohel (circumciser).
- `Assorted Blessings and Prayers/Brit Mila:26`: Role of response: draft says 'congregation' but instruction says 'congregation and mohel'. Should be 'together' or split?
- `Fast Days and Mourning/Seventeenth of Tammuz:40`: The instruction mentions 'Half Kaddish' and 'Torah reading' but does not specify the exact node or condition for the Kaddish or the Torah reading in this specific context (e.g., is it a separate node or part of the service flow?).

- `Weekday Mincha/Amida:82`: English e65 corresponds to Hebrew h82, not h65. h65 is 'Yehi Ratzon' (prayer), e65 is 'Avinu Malkeinu' line.

- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:290`: This piyyut (Sukkat David) is specific to Sefard/Baghdadi custom for Sukkot Musaf; the leaf default condition 'pesach || shavuot || sukkot' is too broad for this specific text.
- `Prayers for Three Festivals/Mussaf:207`: Custom varies between Magdil (weekdays) and Migdol (Shabbat/Yom Tov). Source uses brackets to indicate alternative.

### Ambiguous tagging (82)

- `Weekdays/Morning Blessings:5`: Sefaria text mixes two alternatives (men/women) in one segment without clear instruction on which is default or when to use which. Splitting required.
- `Weekdays/Accepting the Sovereignty of Heaven:9`: English-only instruction about saying the full Shema paragraphs here if time is short; no Hebrew counterpart in this leaf. Condition unclear (time pressure vs. custom).
- `Weekdays/Blessings of the Shema:16`: Part 1: New light insertion condition unclear; tagged as roshChodesh || yomTov || chanukah but may vary by custom.
- `Weekdays/Viduy:8`: The text of h5 (piyyut) is said only when there is a minyan. The English instruction e6 says 'When praying without a minyan continue with...'. This implies h5 is conditional on minyan, but the Hebrew text itself has no explicit rubric. The condition 'minyan' should be applied to h5, h6, and h7.
- `Weekdays/Pesukei DeZimra:2`: Text is a Kabbalistic formula (Yichud) not found in all siddurim; some say it, some do not. The siddur presents it as part of the prayer text but it functions as an instruction/intro.
- `Weekdays/The Amida:10`: The Hebrew text mixes two alternatives (winter/diaspora vs summer/Israel) in one segment without a clear conditional marker in the source text itself, requiring a split based on custom.
- `Weekdays/The Amida:17`: Instruction 'קהל then ש"ץ' implies congregation starts, but standard Ashkenaz custom for Kedushah is chazzan starts 'Yekadesh' then congregation repeats. Need to verify if this siddur intends a different custom or if the instruction is misleading.
- `Weekdays/The Amida:56`: Condition for personal supplication (h48) not explicitly stated; assumed weekdays only based on context.
- `Weekdays/The Amida:75`: Instruction 'In a house of mourning' is not explicit in the Hebrew text; inferred from custom.
- `Weekdays/The Daily Psalm:43`: Instruction 'Bless the Lord' appears as a prayer segment in Hebrew but is an instruction in English; condition for Israel custom when no Torah reading is unclear from text.
- `Weekdays/Tahanun:2`: Instruction for Mon/Thu vs other days not explicit in Hebrew text; inferred from English rubric.
- `Weekdays/Conclusion of the Service:1`: Instruction about touching tefillin at symbols ° and °° appears in English but has no Hebrew counterpart in the selected segments. The symbols are not present in the Hebrew text provided.
- `Weekdays/Minha for Weekdays:62`: Text is in <small> but no explicit instruction says 'only on Tisha B'Av'. Context implies it, but siddur text is ambiguous.
- `Weekdays/Ma'ariv for Weekdays:46`: Instruction 'In winter' vs 'In Israel in summer' implies a calendar condition not explicitly defined in variables for this specific phrasing. Need to map to mashivHaruach/moridHatal logic.
- `Weekdays/Ma'ariv for Weekdays:69`: Winter/summer conditions for talUmatar depend on location (Israel vs Diaspora) and specific dates; siddur text implies Diaspora dates but does not explicitly state 'Diaspora'.
- `Weekdays/Ma'ariv for Weekdays:107`: Yehi Ratzon text appears before Kaddish Shalem in this chunk; verify if it belongs to Aleinu or is a separate concluding prayer.
- `Weekdays/Ma'ariv for Weekdays:130`: The text mixes the standard Oseh Shalom with the Aseret Yemei Teshuva variant in one segment. The instruction 'בעשרת ימי תשובה' suggests the second part is conditional, but the first part is also present. Need to confirm if the first part is said only outside Aseret Yemei Teshuva or if both are said in some customs.
- `Weekdays/Counting of the Omer:55`: English rubric 'Some add:' has no Hebrew counterpart in the selected segments; likely refers to h54 or h55 but unclear which.
- `Shabbat/Eiruvin:2`: Instruction text in English only; no Hebrew counterpart in selected segments.
- `Shabbat/Candle Lighting:4`: The text contains parenthetical options for Shabbat vs. Yom Tov; the exact condition for when to say the full text vs. the shortened text is not explicitly stated in the source.
- `Shabbat/Kabbalat Shabbat:42`: Alternative text for Shabbat Shuva needs a specific condition variable.
- `Shabbat/Ma'ariv for Shabbat and Yom Tov:56`: Ya'aleh VeYavo insertion condition unclear for specific festivals
- `Shabbat/Ma'ariv for Shabbat and Yom Tov:62`: Al HaNissim insertion condition unclear for specific festivals
- `Shabbat/Kiddush and Zemirot for Shabbat Evening:29`: The text 'Asar HaSukkah' is present but the condition for when it is said (Shabbat Chol HaMoed Sukkot) is not explicitly stated in the Hebrew text, only in the English instruction e28. The Hebrew text itself is unconditional in the source.
- `Shabbat/Nishmat:9`: Instruction 'Stand until after Barekhu' refers to a future page; unclear if this is a gesture tag or a note.
- `Shabbat/Ma'ariv for Shabbat and Yom Tov:56`: Instruction 'On Rosh Chodesh and Chol HaMoed' applies to the whole paragraph, but the text contains specific alternatives for Rosh Chodesh, Pesach, and Sukkot. The condition for the whole paragraph is likely 'roshChodesh || cholHamoedPesach || cholHamoedSukkot', but the specific alternatives need precise 'when' conditions.
- `Shabbat/Shaharit for Shabbat and Yom Tov:8`: Part 6: Instruction 'On Shabbat Shuva' appears inline; unclear if it replaces the preceding text or is an addition.
- `Shabbat/The Amida for Shabbat:57`: English e49-e51 contains a conditional ending for Shabbat Shuva outside Israel not present in the Hebrew h49.
- `Shabbat/Reading of the Torah:71`: Instruction 'קהל וקורא' (Congregation and Reader) is ambiguous for Kaddish. Standard custom is Reader leads, Congregation responds. Tagged as congregation for the response line, but the instruction implies joint recitation which is non-standard.
- `Shabbat/Blessing the New Month:6`: The text contains placeholders for the month name and day of week, but the exact format for the second day of Rosh Chodesh is unclear. The instruction 'ולמחרתו ביום' suggests a second day, but the structure is ambiguous.
- `Shabbat/The Amida for Shabbat:17`: Instruction 'קהל וש״ץ' implies congregation then chazzan, but text is a single line; verify if split is needed for role assignment.
- `Shabbat/The Amida for Shabbat:51`: The siddur indicates an alternative ending for Sim Shalom on Shabbat Shuva outside Israel, but the condition for when to use the standard ending vs. the alternative is not explicitly stated in the text. The alternative is marked with an asterisk and a note.
- `Shabbat/Musaf for Shabbat:185`: Instruction 'On Shabbat Shuva' appears inline; unclear if it replaces the preceding text or is an addition.
- `Shabbat/Musaf for Shabbat:34`: Instruction mentions 'In winter' and 'In Israel in summer' but does not specify the exact condition for the default text or the alternative. The text 'He makes the wind blow and the rain fall' is for winter (mashivHaruach) in diaspora, and 'He causes the dew to fall' is for summer (moridHatal) in Israel. The siddur text is ambiguous about the default condition for the first phrase.
- `Shabbat/Musaf for Shabbat:61`: Instruction 'בשבת ראש חודש' implies a conditional leaf, but the leaf default is 'shabbat'. The text inside h48-h53 is the Rosh Chodesh Musaf Amidah. This leaf should likely be split or the condition refined to 'shabbat && roshChodesh'.
- `Shabbat/Musaf for Shabbat:141`: Kaddish d'Rabbanan text is missing; only title 'קדיש יתום' is present.
- `Shabbat/Musaf for Shabbat:160`: Responsive poem (Anim Zemirot) lines alternate chazzan/congregation; siddur uses speaker labels but does not explicitly state the alternating pattern for all lines.
- `Shabbat/Musaf for Shabbat:129`: English instruction mentions 'mourners' but the Hebrew text (h129-h144) is the full Anim Zemirot poem, not Mourner's Kaddish. The English seems to conflate the two or refer to a different section.
- `Shabbat/Kiddush and Zemirot for Shabbat Morning:16`: Blessing for dwelling in the sukkah is present in the text but lacks a clear conditional instruction in Hebrew; English draft adds condition 'On Shabbat Chol HaMoed Sukkot'. Verify if this is standard for this nusach or a specific custom.
- `Shabbat/Minha for Shabbat and Yom Tov:71`: Instruction text mixes winter and summer alternatives; split required for correct conditional display.
- `Shabbat/Minha for Shabbat and Yom Tov:31`: Instruction text is enclosed in slashes; unclear if this is a conditional alternative or a fixed instruction for when no Kohen is present. Needs clarification on whether this is said or just a note.
- `Shabbat/Minha for Shabbat and Yom Tov:66`: Instruction 'On Shabbat Shuva' appears inline with the prayer text; unclear if the instruction is part of the prayer or a separate rubric.
- `Shabbat/Minha for Shabbat and Yom Tov:44`: English instruction 'Some add:' refers to h34 but the Hebrew text does not indicate this is optional.
- `Shabbat/Ethics of the Fathers:1:20`: Instruction about Kaddish refers to a page number not in this chunk; condition for minyan is implied but not explicit in text.
- `Festivals/Removal of Hametz:5`: Condition for saying the first Biur Chametz formula (before burning) vs the second (after burning) is not explicit in the text; assumed erevPesach but timing unclear.
- `Festivals/Kiddush for Yom Tov Evening:9`: Parenthetical text for Shabbat vs Yom Tov needs clearer condition handling in source
- `Festivals/Kiddush for Yom Tov Evening:16`: Condition for Shehecheyanu on last nights of Pesach varies by nusach (Israel vs Diaspora)
- `Festivals/Hakafot for Simhat Torah:2`: Instruction mentions 'Full Kaddish (page 496)' and 'law 136/139' which are siddur-specific references not in the corpus variables.
- `Festivals/Amida for Yom Tov:52`: Role of Birkat Kohanim in repetition unclear: is it chazzan or kohanim? Text says 'Leader says' but also mentions 'when no Kohanim bless'.
- `Festivals/Musaf for Rosh Hodesh:12`: Instruction text mixes two conditions (winter/diaspora vs summer/Israel) without explicit variable mapping in source; using mashivHaruach and moridHatal based on standard Ashkenaz custom.
- `Festivals/Musaf for Rosh Hodesh:40`: Instruction 'On Chanukah' appears in the repetition text; unclear if this is a general instruction for the whole blessing or specific to the Al HaNissim insertion. The text itself is Al HaNissim.
- `Festivals/Musaf for Rosh Hodesh:43`: Birkat Kohanim text includes congregation responses inline. The siddur indicates 'Congregation:' but does not specify if the chazzan says the verses or if the kohanim are present. Tagged as chazzan leading with congregation responding, but custom varies.
- `Festivals/Musaf for Rosh Hodesh:49`: Elokai Netzor is typically said after the silent Amidah, but here it appears after the repetition. This may be a specific nusach or a placement error in the source.
- `Festivals/Musaf for Rosh Hodesh:53`: Yehi Ratzon (Temple) is typically said after the silent Amidah or at the end of the service. Its placement here after the repetition is unusual.
- `Festivals/Musaf for Festivals:91`: Instruction 'קהל וש"ץ' implies congregation and leader together, but text is split into two parts in Hebrew (h54, h55) and two in English (e91, e92). Need to clarify if h54 is the full text or just the start.
- `Festivals/Birkat Kohanim:61`: Instruction 'In the Ten Days of Repentance' is embedded in the text; needs split to separate instruction from prayer text.
- `Festivals/Prayer for Rain:12`: The text 'קהל:' appears inline within the piyyut line. The draft splits it, but the exact boundary of the instruction vs prayer text in the source HTML is ambiguous due to the <i> tag placement.
- `Festivals/Prayer for Dew:18`: Text 'שאתה הוא יהוה אלהינו משיב הרוח ומוריד הטל' appears here, but this is the standard winter formula (Mashiv HaRuach). The context is 'Prayer for Dew' (Morid HaTal) for Pesach in Israel. The text should likely be 'מוריד הטל' only, or the condition should be different. The siddur text seems to conflate the two or is a placeholder.
- `Festivals/Hoshanot for Hoshana Raba:68`: Segments h49-h52 are not selected in the source but are part of the Hoshanot text; their inclusion depends on custom.
- `Festivals/Kaparot:2`: Kapparot is a controversial custom; some authorities forbid it. The text assumes the custom is practiced.
- `Festivals/Service for Purim:11`: Instructions refer to page numbers and specific service continuations (Ma'ariv, Kaddish, Aleinu) that are not present in this chunk. The condition for 'Motzaei Shabbat' is unclear without the surrounding context.
- `Festivals/Selihot for the Tenth of Tevet:2`: Role of opening Selichot piyyutim varies by custom; tagged as individual but may be chazzan-led or responsive in some nusachim.
- `Festivals/Selihot for the Tenth of Tevet:38`: Responsive pattern for acrostic piyyutim (h25-h38) varies; some lines may be chazzan only, others congregation only, or alternating.
- `Giving Thanks/Consecration of a House:4`: English instruction 'Where appropriate' lacks a clear Hebrew counterpart or condition in the source text.
- `The Cycle of Life/Brit Mila:25`: Instruction says 'In Israel the father adds (some outside Israel add it as well)'. Condition unclear.
- `The Cycle of Life/Birkat HaMazon in a House of Mourning:12`: Instruction refers to page 986; context does not include that text. App may need to jump to a different chunk.
- `The Cycle of Life/Funeral Service:28`: Text 'אותך/אותך/אתכם' has multiple forms; unclear which is default or when each applies.
- `The Cycle of Life/Funeral Service:26`: Text 'עשה שלום/השלום' has multiple forms; unclear which is default or when each applies.
- `The Cycle of Life/Funeral Service:23`: Text 'לעלא מכל ברכתא/לעלא לעלא מכל ברכתא' has multiple forms; unclear which is default or when each applies.
- `Torah Readings/Weekly Portions for Mondays, Thursdays and Shabbat Minha:111`: Text contains '[במתי]' indicating a textual variant or correction; source text needs verification for final vowelization/letter.
- `Torah Readings/Weekly Portions for Mondays, Thursdays and Shabbat Minha:117`: Text contains '[אש דת]' indicating a textual variant or correction; source text needs verification for final vowelization/letter.
- `Torah Readings/Weekly Portions for Mondays, Thursdays and Shabbat Minha:107`: Text contains '[וצבוים]' indicating a textual variant or correction; source text needs verification for final vowelization/letter.
- `Torah Readings/Fast Days:6`: Instruction refers to 'page 515' for blessings after Haftarah; page number is siddur-specific and not a corpus variable.
- `Torah Readings/Pesah:2`: Part 1: Aliyah markers (Levi, Shelishi) are embedded in the text; custom varies on whether they are read aloud or just visual guides.
- `Torah Readings/Shabbat Hol HaMo'ed:5`: Instruction references page numbers and Maftir details that are not present in the Hebrew text; the Hebrew text ends after the Haftara. The English instruction about the Maftir being read from a second scroll and the specific page numbers for Pesach/Sukkot Maftirim are siddur-specific navigation aids not reflected in the Hebrew source.
- `Torah Readings/Rosh Hodesh:2`: English text describes multiple customs (Diaspora vs. Israel, and a special custom for Rosh Chodesh Tevet) that are not reflected in the Hebrew text or the leaf's condition. The Hebrew text contains only the standard reading instructions for the first three aliyot and the fourth. The English text adds a specific custom for Tevet and a different division for Israel. This requires a new minhag variable (e.g., x_roshChodeshReadingCustom) or splitting the English segment to handle the conditional parts.
- `Torah Readings/Hanukka:20`: Instruction mentions 'page 1111' for Rosh Chodesh reading; page number may vary by siddur edition.
- `Torah Readings/Seventh Day of Pesah:13`: English heading mentions Shavuot and Shemini Atzeret, but Hebrew text (h13) is only for the last day of Pesach. The leaf path is 'Seventh Day of Pesah'. The English seems to be a combined header for multiple occasions, while the Hebrew is specific.
- `Torah Readings/Hol HaMo'ed Sukkot:3`: Diaspora reading for Day 1 is not explicitly marked; assumed !il based on structure.
- `Torah Readings/Shemini Atzeret:7`: English instruction references page 514 for Haftara blessings; no Hebrew counterpart in this leaf. May be a cross-reference to a separate section.
- `Torah Readings/Simhat Torah:2`: Instruction refers to a specific page number and text for 'Shishi' (6th aliya) in Israel on Shabbat, but the Hebrew text for that specific alternative is not present in the provided segment. The condition for this instruction is unclear without the alternative text.
- `Torah Readings/Hatan Torah and Hatan Bereshit:5`: Part 1: Instruction 'On Shabbat Chatan Torah' implies a conditional reading, but Simchat Torah is always on Shabbat. The condition might be redundant or refer to a specific custom where this reading is only used on Simchat Torah itself, not other Shabbatot.

- `Torah Readings/Piyutei Geula; Berah Dodi:2`: Piyutei Geula are said on specific days of Pesach; the instruction implies a custom that may vary by nusach or community.

### Missing text in the source (13)

- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:124`: Source text is null. The draft implies a split of 'עשה (בעשי"ת השלום) שלום במרומיו' but the text is not present in the provided segment source.
- `Lag BaOmer Songs/Ashreinu Uma Naim:49`: Segments h49-h52 (Ayin, Pe) are present in source but not selected for annotation; they are part of the acrostic poem.
- `Blessings/Me'ein Shalosh:17`: Segment h17 is not selected but contains text for 'grain and wine together' which should be aligned with h7. The text is present in the source but not in the selected segments list.
- `Third Meal/Zemirot:49`: Segment h49 (and h50-h52) is not selected in the input but appears to be part of the Zemirot sequence (acrostic 'Miyud'). The input only selects up to h48. The remaining verses are missing from the selection.
- `Holidays/Prayer for Dew:49`: Segment h49 (Elokai Netzor) is not selected but appears in the source; verify if it should be included in the leaf.
- `Pesach Haggadah/Hallel:49`: Segment h49 (Laguzar Yam-Suf) is not selected but is part of the Hallel sequence; ensure it is included in the final corpus.
- `Pesach Haggadah/Hallel:50`: Segment h50 (Veha'avir Yisrael) is not selected but is part of the Hallel sequence; ensure it is included in the final corpus.
- `Pesach Haggadah/Hallel:51`: Segment h51 (Vener Paroh) is not selected but is part of the Hallel sequence; ensure it is included in the final corpus.
- `Pesach Haggadah/Hallel:52`: Segment h52 (Lemolech Amu) is not selected but is part of the Hallel sequence; ensure it is included in the final corpus.
- `Simchat Torah/Hakafot:49`: Hebrew text for Circle 4 (h49) is not selected in the input, but English e49 is present. The Hebrew source for h49 is present in the raw data but marked selected:false.
- `Yotzerot/Musaf for Shekalim:49`: Segment h49 is not selected but appears to be part of the Shekalim piyyut sequence; verify if it should be included or if it is an alternative ending.
- `Yotzerot/Musaf for Hachodesh:49`: Segment h49 (piyyut) and h50 (chazzan response) are present in source but not selected for review; they appear to be part of the Musaf Kedushah piyyut but are excluded from the required_review list.
- `Fast Days/Yom Kippur Katan:49`: Responsive piyyut lines (Chazzan/Congregation) are present in source but not selected; ensure they are included in the final tagged file if they are part of the standard text.

### Misplaced text (1)

- `Shabbat Morning Services/Prayer for Deceased:3`: English text mentions 'souls of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel, and Leah' which is not present in the Hebrew source h3. The Hebrew source is a generic template for a specific individual, while the English appears to be a different, more elaborate Yizkor text.

### Duplicated text (2)

- `Fast Days/Selichot for Taanit Esther:17`: Text identical to h7; likely a duplicate or intended for a different role not specified in source.
- `Fast Days/Selichot for Taanit Esther:18`: Note identical to h11 but with different author name (Shimon ben Yitzchak); likely a variant or duplicate.

### Ambiguous tagging (106)

- `Weekday Shacharit/Morning Prayer:3`: The instruction 'On days when Tachanun is not said' implies the following prayer (h4) is said only when Tachanun IS said. However, the condition for h4 is not explicitly defined in the source. The draft tags h4 as 'prayer' without a 'when' condition. This creates a conflict: if h4 is always said, the instruction is wrong. If h4 is conditional, the condition is missing. The 'when' for h4 should be 'tachanunShacharit'.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Morning Prayer:4`: See issue on h3. The prayer 'Rabbono shel Olam' (h4) appears to be conditional on Tachanun being said, but lacks a 'when' tag. The instruction (h3) says 'On days when Tachanun is not said, this is not said'. This implies h4 is said ONLY when Tachanun IS said.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:11`: Condition for Morid HaTal is !mashivHaruach, but the text says 'In summer'. Need to confirm if this is correct for Ashkenaz (who say nothing in summer) or if it's a Sefard/Israel custom.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:57`: Summer text 'beracha' vs winter 'tal umatar' logic depends on location (Israel vs Diaspora) and season. Variable mashivHaruach covers winter rain, but summer text is not explicitly tagged with !mashivHaruach in all contexts. Need to confirm if 'beracha' is the default for Israel summer or if it's omitted.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:61`: The note mentions 'Teka' (Shofar) which is specific to Rosh Hashana, but the rule for forgetting Tal Umatar applies generally to the Amidah. The text seems to conflate the general rule with a specific Rosh Hashana scenario or uses 'Teka' as a placeholder for the start of the next blessing.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:86`: The split parts for h86, h87, h88 are pre-split by the engine. The instruction part is the label (e.g., 'For Rosh Chodesh:') and the prayer part is the text to insert. The 'when' condition should be on the prayer part, but the instruction part also needs to be hidden when not applicable. The current draft has 'when' on the prayer part only.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:96`: Modim d'Rabbanan is said by the congregation in the silent Amidah. The role is 'congregation' and amidah is 'silent'. The instruction h95 explains this. The text h96 is the prayer itself.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:124`: The draft splits h124 into parts, but the source text is null. The split marker 'עשה' appears in h123 as part of the prayer text, not as a separate instruction. The instruction 'בעשי"ת' is embedded in h123. The draft seems to be trying to split h123 and h124 incorrectly or the source text for h124 is missing. The text 'עשה (בעשי"ת השלום) שלום במרומיו' is likely a single segment in the raw file that needs splitting, but the provided segments show h123 ending with 'עשה למען קדשתך' and h124 starting with 'עשה (בעשי"ת השלום)'. This suggests a misalignment in the provided segments or the draft. I will assume the draft intends to split the text 'עשה (בעשי"ת השלום) שלום במרומיו' which is currently in h124 (source null) but logically belongs to the end of h123 or is a separate segment. Given the source is null for h124, I cannot split it. I will tag h124 as prayer with the correct node and gestures, and add an issue about the missing source text for the split.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Amidah:123`: The draft for h124 references a split that seems to belong to the end of h123 or a missing segment. The text 'עשה (בעשי"ת השלום) שלום במרומיו' is not in h123's source. This requires manual verification of the raw file.
- `Weekday Shacharit/For Monday & Thursday:30`: The instruction 'בעשי"ת' (During the Ten Days of Repentance) is embedded in the Kaddish text. The split separates the instruction from the conditional text 'ולעלא מכל', but the default text 'לעלא' is said outside Aseret Yemei Teshuva. The condition 'aseretYemeiTeshuva' is applied to the alternative part.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Ashrei:2`: The list of days for omitting Psalm 20 includes 'Chol HaMoed' and 'house of mourning' but the condition in h4 is a complex boolean. The note mentions 'entire month of Nissan' and other specific dates not in the standard variable set. Need to verify if 'houseOfMourning' covers all cases or if a new variable is needed for the specific list in the note.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Ashrei:4`: The condition for h4 is a long boolean expression. The note h2 lists specific days (Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, Purim, etc.) and also 'entire month of Nissan', 'Pesach Sheni', 'Lag-b'omer', etc. The current condition in h4 does not cover all these specific cases (e.g., 'entire month of Nissan'). A new variable or a more complex condition is needed to accurately reflect the note.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Ashrei:16`: The condition 'monThu || torahReading' is used for h16. The note h24 says 'On Mondays, Thursdays and other days when the Torah is taken out'. This implies that on days other than Mon/Thu where Torah is read (e.g., Rosh Chodesh, Chol Hamoed), this psalm is also said. The condition seems correct but needs verification against the specific nusach.
- `Additional Prayers /Chapter of Manna:1`: English note says the prayer preceding the Torah chapter should not be recited on Shabbos or Yom Tov, but the Hebrew instruction does not mention this restriction. The Hebrew says 'It is good to recite... every day'.
- `Additional Prayers /Chapter of Song:103`: The text contains a narrative commentary (Rabbi Yishaya's story) followed by concluding blessings. The draft tags the whole segment as 'prayer', but the first part is clearly a story/commentary. The split should separate the narrative from the final blessings.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amidah:11`: Condition for Morid HaTal is ambiguous in Ashkenaz outside Israel. Sefaria draft says 'In summer' but Hebrew says 'Bakitz'. In Ashkenaz outside Israel, Morid HaTal is not said in summer. The condition should be 'il && !mashivHaruach' or similar, but the siddur text does not specify.
- `Weekday Mincha/Tachanun:1`: The instruction lists many days when Tachanun is omitted, but the condition for the leaf itself is tachanunMincha. The instruction text itself contains the logic for when it is NOT said. This is a standard pattern, but the specific list of days (e.g., '14 and 15 Adar Rishon') might need a specific variable if the engine doesn't handle the list logic internally. The current 'when' on the leaf is correct for the prayer text following.
- `Weekday Mincha/Avinu Malkeinu:1`: The note mentions 'public fast days' and 'Ten Days of Repentance' but does not explicitly state the condition for recitation in the leaf itself, though the leaf default is null. The leaf condition 'aseretYemeiTeshuva || publicFast' was added based on the note content.
- `Weekday Mincha/Amidah:88`: Pre-split parts for h88, h89, h90 need verification against source text. The source text for h88 is null in the provided JSON, but the draft has parts. This suggests a pre-split that needs to be validated against the actual raw text.
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:100`: Part 2: The Hebrew text 'בעשי"ת' is an instruction to insert text, but the exact insertion point and text ('השלום' vs 'השלום' in the phrase 'עושה שלום במרומיו') is ambiguous without the full context of the siddur's layout. The draft en rendering assumes 'the peace' is inserted, but the Hebrew source only says 'בעשי"ת' (during Aseret Yemei Teshuva).
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:109`: Part 2: Same as h100.1: The Hebrew instruction 'בעשי"ת' is ambiguous regarding the exact text to insert.
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:119`: Part 2: Same as h100.1: The Hebrew instruction 'בעשי"ת' is ambiguous regarding the exact text to insert.
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:100`: Part 7: The English instruction 'Ten Days of Penitence:' corresponds to the Hebrew 'בעשי"ת', but the exact insertion text is not specified in the Hebrew source.
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:109`: Part 7: Same as e100.6.
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:119`: Part 7: Same as e100.6.
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:111`: Part 2: The English instruction 'Ten Days of Penitence:' corresponds to the Hebrew 'בעשי"ת', but the exact insertion text is not specified in the Hebrew source.
- `Weekday Maariv/Amidah:40`: Instruction says 'summer months' but Ashkenaz diaspora omits the line entirely in summer; Sefard/Israel says 'blessing'. The condition !mashivHaruach is used for the line, but the instruction text implies a different custom. Clarify if this siddur is Sefard or Ashkenaz.
- `Various Blessings/Sheva Berachot:2`: Instruction 'After Birkas Hamazon the Seven Berachos begin here' implies a specific order (Hamazon first, then Sheva Berachot). In many customs, the Sheva Berachot are recited *during* the Zimun (before Hamazon) or immediately after the Zimun but before Hamazon. The text placement and instruction may be specific to a custom where they are said after Hamazon, or it may be a misplacement in the source. Needs verification of the intended order.
- `Birchat HaMazon/Birchat HaMazon:53`: Part 1: Instruction 'For Rosh Chodesh:' implies condition, but text 'ראש החדש הזה' is part of the prayer. Need to ensure condition applies to the whole phrase or split correctly.
- `Birchat HaMazon/Brit Milah:6`: Part 5: Text 'נ"א פסולה אם שלש לא אלה יעשה לה' is unclear; likely means 'Some say it is invalid if three do not perform these tasks'
- `Birchat HaMazon/Brit Milah:15`: Part 4: Instruction text is cut off; likely should end with ')'
- `Shabbat Eve Maariv/Shema & Blessings:22`: Instruction mentions 'prayer for the three festivals' but no specific text is provided in this chunk; likely refers to a separate leaf or section not included here.
- `Shabbat Eve Maariv/Amidah:24`: Instruction mentions 'Purim the triple' (Purim in a walled city) but the condition logic for 'triple' Purim is unclear in the source text; using shushanPurim as the condition.
- `Shabbat Eve Maariv/Vayechulu:16`: Instruction says 'From Passover until Shavuot', but the Omer is counted from the second night of Passover until the day before Shavuot. The condition should be 'omer' (which covers the counting period).
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Pesukei D'Zimrah:103`: Part 3: The text '( בעשי"ת ולעלא מכל)' is a conditional insertion. The 'when' condition should be aseretYemeiTeshuva, but the exact phrasing of the instruction in the source is implicit.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Shema & Blessings:18`: Part 2: The instruction '(Ahavah Rabbah)' suggests an alternative for weekdays, but the condition for when to use 'Ahavat Olam' vs 'Ahavah Rabbah' is not explicitly defined in the text. In Ashkenaz, 'Ahavat Olam' is used on weekdays and 'Ahavah Rabbah' on Shabbat/Yom Tov. This segment appears to be a note for the weekday version, but the context is Shabbat.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Shema & Blessings:20`: Part 1: The instruction says 'An individual says' but does not specify the condition (e.g., 'without a minyan'). The text implies it is said when alone, but the exact condition variable is not provided in the source.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Shema & Blessings:34`: The instruction mentions 'festival prayers' but does not specify which prayers or the exact condition (e.g., 'yomTov && !shabbat'). The text implies it is for Yom Tov, but the specific insertion point and content are not detailed.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Amidah:55`: Instruction says 'On Rosh Chodesh' but English says 'On Shabbos-Rosh Chodesh, on Yom Tov...'. The Hebrew text is specific to Rosh Chodesh. The English seems to conflate multiple customs or is a general note for Hallel. The Hebrew instruction is likely specific to the Rosh Chodesh Shabbat context of this leaf.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Amidah:72`: Instruction says 'until after Hoshana Raba'. English says 'through Shemini Atzeres'. These are slightly different dates (Hoshana Raba is the 7th of Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret is the 8th). The Hebrew text is the primary source; the English translation may be imprecise or reflect a different custom.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Shabbat Torah Reading:9`: Part 2: The instruction 'On Rosh Hashanah, do not say this' is ambiguous. Does it mean omit the entire parenthetical section, or just the specific phrase about forgiveness? The text structure suggests omitting the forgiveness request, but the condition logic needs clarification.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Amidah:35`: Instruction mentions 'Purim Meshulash' but does not specify if this applies to all Purim on Shabbat or only the specific case of Purim Meshulash (14/15 Adar on Shabbat).
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Amidah:37`: Part 3: Optional phrase in parentheses; custom varies on whether to say it.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Amidah:38`: Part 3: Optional phrase in parentheses; custom varies on whether to say it.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Amidah:48`: Instruction says 'Some say this prayer here' but does not specify which custom or condition.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Amidah:50`: Page reference '000-000' is a placeholder.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Blessings on Torah Reading:2`: English specifies 'Kohein' for the first blessing, but the Hebrew instruction 'העולה אומר' applies to any person called up. The custom of the Kohen taking the first aliyah is implied but not explicit in the Hebrew text.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Blessing of New Month:5`: Part 2: Instruction says '[Day of week]' but context implies month name; siddur text may be inconsistent.
- `Musaf:148`: Label 'חו"ק' (Chuk) is unclear; likely a typo for 'חזן' (Chazzan) or a specific role not defined in standard schema.
- `Musaf:148`: Part 1: 'חו"ק' is an unusual abbreviation for 'חזן' (Chazzan); standard is 'חזן' or 'חזן:'
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Prayer for Mother after Chilbirth:4`: Part 2: Instruction says 'Bar Mitzvah boy' in the blessing for a female birth. Likely a copy-paste error from the male version; should probably be 'Bat Mitzvah' or omitted.
- `Shabbat Morning Services/Haftarah Blessings:10`: Part 2: Instruction 'For Shabbat' implies conditional insertion, but condition logic for Yom Tov on Shabbat needs verification against siddur custom.
- `Musaf:6`: Part 2: Ashkenaz custom outside Israel omits Morid HaTal in summer; siddur text includes it with 'In summer' instruction. Confirm if this siddur is for Israel or Sefard.
- `Musaf:19`: Condition for 'When Rosh Chodesh falls on Shabbat' needs specific variable (e.g., shabbat && roshChodesh).
- `Musaf:27`: Part 2: Condition for leap year insertion needs specific variable (e.g., leapYear && hMonth < 1).
- `Musaf:29`: Part 2: Text '(the ascent)' appears to be a gloss or instruction, not prayer text. Clarify if it should be split as instruction.
- `Shabbat Mincha/Korbanot:20`: Instruction mentions 'Yom Tov that falls on a weekday' but the condition for h21 is yomTov && !shabbat. The text implies a specific prayer for the three pilgrimage festivals (Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot) which is not explicitly tagged in the Hebrew text. The English text e20 aligns with h20 and h21.
- `Shabbat Mincha/Korbanot:39`: The blessing 'Baruch Shefaterani' is traditionally said by the father of a Bar Mitzvah. The node 'lifecycle.brit_mila' is used here, but 'lifecycle.brit_mila' is for circumcision. A more specific node like 'lifecycle.bar_mitzvah' might be needed, or the existing node should be clarified.
- `Shabbat Mincha/Korbanot:40`: The note about the Arizal's custom of looking at the Torah is a kavanah/instruction. The text is tagged as 'note' but the content is more of a custom explanation. The 'cite' field is used, but the source is 'Arizal' which is a general attribution.
- `Shaking Lulav:7`: Shehecheyanu is said on the first day of Sukkot (or first time one takes the lulav), but the condition 'sukkot' covers the whole festival. The siddur text implies 'first time' but the instruction in h6 is general. A more precise condition like 'sukkot && hoshanaDay==1' or a minhag variable might be needed.
- `Holidays/Maariv, Shacharit & Mincha Amidah:9`: Part 2: Morid HaTal is said in Israel or Sefard in summer, but not in Ashkenaz diaspora. The text does not specify the nusach.
- `Holidays/Yizkor:2`: The instruction mixes dates for Pesach and Shavuot with a comma and 'and' in a way that suggests a single list, but the structure is complex. The draft splits it into parts, but the 'prayer' kind for the dates seems incorrect; they are instructions about when to say Yizkor.
- `Holidays/Yizkor:39`: Part 2: The text 'בעשי"ת ולעלא מכל' is a conditional addition. The draft marks it as 'prayer' but it is an instruction to add text. It should be split into an instruction part and a prayer part, or the whole segment should be treated as a conditional prayer with an instruction note.
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:49`: Condition for first day of Sukkot in Diaspora (hoshanaDay==1 && !il) needs verification against variables.json
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:52`: Condition for second day of Sukkot in Diaspora (hoshanaDay==2 && !il) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:56`: Condition for third day of Sukkot in Diaspora (hoshanaDay==3 && !il) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:60`: Condition for fourth day of Sukkot in Diaspora (hoshanaDay==4 && !il) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:64`: Condition for fifth day of Sukkot in Diaspora (hoshanaDay==5 && !il) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:68`: Condition for Hoshana Raba (hoshanaRaba) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:72`: Condition for Shmini Atzeret/Simchat Torah (shminiAtzeret || simchatTorah) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:75`: Part 2: Condition for Shabbat (shabbat) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:77`: Part 3: Condition for Shabbat (shabbat) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:77`: Part 5: Condition for Shabbat (shabbat) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:77`: Part 7: Condition for Shabbat (shabbat) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:80`: Part 2: Condition for chazzan's repetition (chazarah) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:84`: Part 2: Condition for chazzan's repetition (chazarah) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:85`: Condition for chazzan's repetition (chazarah) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:89`: Condition for chazzan's repetition (chazarah) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Musaf Amidah:93`: Condition for custom (x_yehiRatzonAfterAmidah) needs verification
- `Holidays/Yom Tov Daytime Kiddush:2`: The instruction '(For Shabbat)' implies this text is said only when Yom Tov falls on Shabbat, but the condition logic for Yom Tov on Shabbat needs verification against the specific festival variables.
- `Pesach Haggadah/Nirtzah:12`: Draft splits h12 into instruction and prayer, but the text 'ברוך אתה יהוה (יוד, הא, ואו, הא)' is a prayer formula with a gloss. The instruction part should be the gloss only, or the whole segment should be prayer with a note.
- `Pesach Haggadah/Nirtzah:13`: The text contains placeholders '<<היום יום אחד לעומר:>>' which need to be replaced by the actual day count. This is a dynamic part of the Omer counting.
- `Pesach Haggadah/Nirtzah:26`: The instruction 'בליל ראשון אומרים' implies the following text is only for the first night. However, the text 'ויהי בחצי הלילה' is a piyyut that is often said on all nights of Pesach in some customs, or only on the first. The condition needs clarification based on the specific nusach.
- `Sukkot/Order of Hoshanot:3`: Condition for 'first day of Sukkot falls on Monday' is not a standard variable; requires calculation of hDay=1 and dow=1 (Monday) or similar logic.
- `Shavuot:3`: The text 'אקדמות מילין, ושריות שותא' appears to be a mix of the title and the first line of the piyyut. The draft treats it as prayer, but the first word 'אקדמות' is the title. Consider splitting if the source text is intended to be read as part of the poem.
- `Yotzerot/Parashat Sekalim:41`: Parenthetical text (Gra version) is unclear if it is said or just a note; treated as prayer text in draft but may be a note.
- `Yotzerot/Parashat Zachor:20`: Part 1: Source text 'חו"ק' likely means 'קהל' (Congregation) but is abbreviated; confirmed by context of response.
- `Yotzerot/Parashat HaChodesh:49`: Instruction says 'On Rosh Chodesh' but the leaf is for Parashat HaChodesh (Shabbat before Rosh Chodesh). Should this be conditional on roshChodesh? Or is it a mistake in the source?
- `Yotzerot/Shabbat HaGadol:49`: Segment h49 contains explanatory notes about the Seder (Why the lamb? Why 4 days before? Why blood on lintel?). It is not selected in the input, but appears in the source. If it is part of the Yotzerot piyyut, it should be selected and tagged as 'note' or 'commentary'. If it is a separate halachic section, it should be in a different leaf. Currently unselected and untagged.
- `Yotzerot/Shabbat HaGadol:50`: Segment h50 contains explanatory notes about the Seder (Why chametz for 6 hours? Why matzah? Why maror? Why charoset? Why two meats? Why lift the plate? Why vegetables first? Why two blessings?). It is not selected in the input. Same issue as h49.
- `Yotzerot/Shabbat HaGadol:51`: Segment h51 contains explanatory notes about the Seder (Why 4 cups? Why recline?). It is not selected in the input. Same issue as h49.
- `Yotzerot/Shabbat HaGadol:52`: Segment h52 contains a piyyut about holiness ('Ne'aleh bekedushato...'). It is not selected in the input. It seems to be the conclusion of the Yotzerot or a separate piyyut. Needs selection and tagging.
- `Yotzerot/Shabbat HaGadol:55`: Part 4: The text 'בקול רעש גדול...' seems to be part of the chazzan's description of the Kedushah, but the split puts it as prayer. Verify if this is instruction or prayer.
- `Yotzerot/Haggadah for Shabbat Hagadol:1`: Title 'Haggadah for Shabbat Hagadol' suggests a specific custom; standard Haggadah is used on Shabbat Hagadol, but some add specific prayers. Unclear if this text is the full Haggadah or just the opening.
- `Chanukah/Torah Reading:3`: Instruction mentions 'Elyasaph' for the third reader on day 1, but h6 ends at 'Nachshon ben Aminadav'. Need to verify if the text in h6 is complete or if the instruction refers to a different stopping point.
- `Purim/Krovetz L'Purim:62`: Parenthetical text (יחד) and (וכל טוב) in Birkat Kohanim: unclear if these are optional additions for specific customs or if they indicate a split between chazzan and congregation roles.
- `Fast Days/Selichot for First Monday:1`: 'First Monday' likely refers to the first Monday of the Selichot cycle (after Rosh Chodesh MarCheshvan), but the exact calendar condition is unclear without context.
- `Fast Days/Selichot for Taanit Esther:19`: Fragment 'Our God and God of our fathers' appears as a heading or start of a new selichah; context unclear if it belongs to h20 or is a separate unit.
- `Fast Days/Selichot for Taanit Esther:20`: Long acrostic selichah; unclear if it is a separate unit or continuation of h19. No clear break in source.
- `Fast Days/El Maleh Prayer:2`: The date '5508' (1748) is specific to the Nemirov massacre, but the heading says '17th of Tammuz'. The 17th of Tammuz is a public fast for the destruction of the Temple, but this specific El Maleh is for the Nemirov pogrom. The siddur may be conflating the two or using this text for the fast day in this nusach. The text itself is a specific memorial for Nemirov.
- `Fast Days/Selichot for 20 Sivan:48`: Note about the author of the Akedah piyyut (Meir bar Yitzchak Elazar) is present but not selected; unclear if it should be tagged as a note or omitted.
- `Torah Readings/Torah Reading for Shabbat Mincha & Monday, Thursday:49`: Parashat Vayikra and Tzav (h49-h52) are not selected; unclear if they are part of the Monday/Thursday cycle or omitted.
- `Torah Readings/Fast Day Torah Reading:2`: Part 5: The text starts with a maqaf (hyphen) and 'מפטיר' (maftir) attached to the first word. This suggests it is the Maftir reading, but the instruction label says 'Thursday' (the third aliyah). In a public fast, the reading is Exodus 32:11-14 (1st aliyah), 34:1-10 (2nd aliyah), and 34:29-35 (3rd aliyah). The text provided for the 'Thursday' part is Exodus 34:1-10 (the 2nd aliyah) followed by the Maftir (34:29-35). The 'Monday' part is Exodus 32:11-14. The 'Thursday' label seems to indicate the 3rd aliyah (Maftir) is read on Thursday, but the text includes the 2nd aliyah. This needs clarification: is the 2nd aliyah read on Thursday, or is the Maftir read on Thursday? The text combines them.
- `Torah Readings/Torah Reading for Chol Hamoed Pesach:15`: Instruction 'If it is Monday' refers to the day of the week, but the condition for reading the previous day's portion depends on the specific calendar date of Chol HaMoed. The siddur implies a rule based on the day of the week, but the exact logic for which portion to read on which day of Chol HaMoed is not fully explicit in the text provided.
- `Torah Readings/Torah Reading for Chol Hamoed Sukkot:2`: The instruction mixes Israel and Diaspora customs for Chol HaMoed Sukkot. The text implies a specific reading schedule for each day, but the exact mapping of 'first day' etc. to the holiday days (1-7) vs. the reading order is complex and varies by custom. The text also mentions 'Hoshana Raba' specifically, which is day 7, but the schedule for days 1-6 in the Diaspora is described in a way that might imply a different structure than standard. Needs clarification on whether this is a general guide or a specific nusach instruction.
- `Priestly Blessing:10`: The instruction mentions 'Shaarei Tziyon' but does not specify the exact section or page number.

### English alignment gaps (9)

- `Fast Days/Selichot for Childrens' Illness:2`: No English segment provided for prayer
- `Fast Days/Selichot for Childrens' Illness:3`: No English segment provided for prayer

- `Weekday Mincha/Tachanun:21`: The text 'בעשי"ת' (During the Ten Days of Repentance) appears in the Kaddish. The condition should be 'aseretYemeiTeshuva'. The draft has 'en' but no 'when'. Need to add 'when': 'aseretYemeiTeshuva' to the instruction part.

### Customs the taggers needed (17)

- `Weekday Shacharit/Ashrei:20`: Part 3: The instruction 'During the Ten Days of Repentance' adds 'and far above' to the Kaddish. This is a standard Ashkenaz custom, but the variable 'aseretYemeiTeshuva' is used. Ensure this is the correct variable for this specific addition.
- `Weekday Shacharit/Ashrei:23`: Part 2: The instruction 'During the Ten Days of Repentance' adds 'the peace' to the Kaddish. This is a standard Ashkenaz custom, but the variable 'aseretYemeiTeshuva' is used. Ensure this is the correct variable for this specific addition.

- `Shabbat Eve Maariv/Vayechulu:15`: Part 2: 'Kadosh x3' instruction implies repeating the phrase 'Baruch Hashem LeOlam' three times. Some customs say 'Kadosh' three times, others say the full phrase. Tagged as repeat:3 on the phrase.
- `Shabbat Eve Maariv/Vayechulu:15`: English says 'congregation responds and Chazzan repeats', implying the full phrase is said by both. Hebrew says 'Kadosh x3'. This may be a nusach difference or a translation nuance. Tagged as congregation_then_chazzan with repeat:3.
- `Shabbat Evening Meal/Zemirot:83`: Part 2: Alternative text '(טובה)' for 'חמדה' in the blessing over the land, likely a nusach variation.
